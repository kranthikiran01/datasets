Why wouldn't we use the EEI form in Ontario?  The markets will be integrated, 
at least in part, into the US.  We could have an annex for Ontario.  We will 
be using the EEI form right across the border in the US.  Let 's chat about 
this.

Chris, Greg is putting the finishing touches on the Power Master as well as a 
GTC.
Greg, Chris needs the Master form ASAP so we can take the lead on this 
Ontario industry form development iniative.  Can you finalize the form and 
prepare a bullet point memo as requested by Chris comparing the differences 
between our form and EEI.
Greg, also you should coordinate a Calgary office meeting with traders and 
originators (not more than 1 hour) to unveil and explain the form ASAP.  
Alberta Market Opening and PPA trading commences Jan 1/01 and we may need 
push to get Masters signed or rely on GTC in the short term.
Chris, you should do likewise in Toronto when appropriate.
Milly, would it be a worthwhile expense for Greg to attend the firstOntario 
industry meeting in Toronto with Chris, as Greg has the background on 
developing the form?
Mark and Elizabeth, FYI.
Peter.

Subject: Power Master
Greg - Sorry to keep bothering you on the Power Master, but I was wondering 
what is the ETA for the form?  The reason I ask is that I am going to be 
involved in the industry push here in Ontario to develop a standard physical 
bilateral agreement.  While it is my understanding that many participants 
want to start with the EEI form and OPGI believes that they already have a 
next to final form, for obvious reasons Peter and Milly would like to see our 
form become the industry standard.
Another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the 
differences between the EEI form and our form and the rationale for the 
differences.  Some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline, 
but I would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in 
developing the form.  
Timing of this is fairly tight as the next meeting on this initiative is 
November 9th.  My goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a 
""Canadianized"" version of the EEI form and then describe the great time and 
effort Enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting 
point.
Apparently EEI will also be in attendance.  I will follow up with Elizabeth 
Sager on what is the status of our relationship with EEI and what was the US 
experience in developing the EEI master.

DON'T FORGET, THIS IS TOMORROW NIGHT!!!  THE GATHERING WILL BE ON THE BACK 
DECK, NOT THE FRONT DECK OR INSIDE (UNLESS IT IS RAINING, IN WHICH CASE WE 
WILL STAY INSIDE).
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In celebration of Jamie Ginsberg's new job and to say farewell prior to her 
impending departure, we are going to have one mother of a happy hour.  Save 
the evening of July 6th (Thursday) to meet for a drink or so and to see Jamie 
off to NYC.   The Timberwolf on Bissonnet will be the place, and the event 
will start at 5:30PM.  It will peak at around midnight, and go downhill from 
there.  
Please join me on the 6th so that we can give Jamie the royal send-off that 
she deserves.  No need to RSVP, just show up when you can.  
Once again, the location is:
THE TIMBERWOLF on Bissonnet just east of Kirby

EGYPT:
Egypt agrees to reduce natural gas price.
09/18/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.
CAIRO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Egypt's Oil Minister Sameh Fahmy said on Monday the
ministry had agreed with international companies to reduce the price of
natural gas produced locally.
He told reporters after a cabinet meeting that approved the agreement that it
would be submitted to parliament, which opens a new session on December 13
after general elections.
Fahmy said the new gas pricing deal, which cuts the price Egypt pays to
foreign companies for their share of gas produced in the country, would save
the government $250 million a year.
He gave no details of the pricing structure, but said it would take effect
from July, 2000, apparently referring to the start of Egypt's fiscal year
(July-June).
The cabinet also approved plans to export natural gas and liquefied natural
gas (LNG) to Turkey and Europe, he said.
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said Egypt would earn an initial $265
million a year from exporting gas by pipeline and about $280 million a year
from LNG exports.
In July, Spanish electricity generator Union Fenosa signed a long-term gas
contract with the state Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to buy 40
billion therms of gas a year.
Spain's third biggest power utility is to receive the gas by pipeline. It said
it had also agreed to invest $1 billion to build a liquefaction plant in Egypt
by 2004.
In June BP-Amoco announced plans to develop an LNG plant to process and ship
LNG to Mediterranean and other markets. BG International said in April it had
agreed with EGPC and Italy's Edison International to build an LNG plant for
export to unspecified buyers in the Mediterranean region.
East Mediterranean Gas, a joint venture of EGPC, Israel's Merhav Group, said
in May it had begun talks with the Israel Electric Corp for laying an
underwater pipeline to supply Egyptian gas to Israel.
It said it planned to build a 780-km (468-mile) pipeline able to carry up to
15 billion cubic metres of gas a year from Egypt to Turkey, with exits to
Israel.
Egypt puts its proven reserves of natural gas at 42.5 trillion cubic feet and
total reserves at around 120 trillion."

>U.S. attack. Unsuccessful, lacking other means of direct retaliation and

>war.
>Negotiations to persuade the Country X to turn over the leader of the
>terrorist assault are opened.
>
>At the same time, the U.S. prepares a plan of attack to apprehend the

Subject: ADEQ permit revisions
Body: 
Cc: gtsiolis@swlaw.com
Bcc: gtsiolis@swlaw.com
As I hope all of you have heard by now, it was a very productive meeting with 
Nancy Wrona. The creative interpretations of the DEQ rules were not necessary 
as Jerry and Nancy hammered out a very date-specific sequence for the permit 
approval activities, as well as clarifying the facility-related activities he 
can do before actual permit issueance. Likely date for permit issuance is by 
Friday, November 16, but this will depend upon EPA cooperation in shortening 
its maximum time allowed for review and assuming no substantive public 
comments. Following is first draft of ""thank-you"" letter to Nancy from Jerry; 
edit freely:
HAND DELIVERY
Nancy Wrona
Director, Air Quality Division
3003 North Central Avenue, 5th floor
Phoenix, Arizona 85012
Re: Transwestern Pipeline, Permits No. 1001601 & 1001602
        Schedule for Permits Issuance
Dear Ms. Wrona;
Thank you again for your significant assistance in detailing a specific 
strategy to complete the process to review and approve the two permit 
revisions for the Transwestern Pipeline compressor stations near Kingman and 
Flagstaff. We were impressed with your willingness and ability to focus on 
the practical approach to improving Arizona's air quality as promptly as 
possible. Working with you and your team of Cathy O'Connell and Prabhat 
Barghava gave our team from Enron Transportation Services and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company (TWP) a strong sense of accomplishment and cooperation.
Following is the schedule that we detailed for subsequent activities:
1. By Friday morning, October 5, Prabhat and Shudeish Mahadev will have 
completed the draft permits; on Friday afternoon, October 5, the ADEQ team, 
including Prabhat and Cathy O'Connell, will conduct the internal review and 
the TSD; by close of business, Friday, October 5, ADEQ will email the draft 
permits revisions to the TWP team (Bill Kendrick, Larry Campbell and me; our 
contact numbers and email addresses are listed on the attached sheet).
2. On Tuesday morning, October 9, at 9 am Phoenix time, there will be a 
call-in conference call between the ADEQ and the TWP teams for final review, 
negotiation, and agreement on the terms and conditions of the draft permits 
revisions.
3. By Thursday, October 11, or Friday, October 12, ADEQ will do first 
publication in the daily newspapers in Mohave and Coconino Counties of the 
30-day public comment period and 30-day notice of a public hearing (at TWP's 
request) for both permits revisions in Williams AZ. Toward meeting the 
agreed-upon permits revisions schedule, TWP hereby requests a hearing on each 
revision pursuant to R18-2-330(E) and asks that ADEQ include the required 
notices of hearing in all notices of the public's opportunity to comment 
pursuant to R18-2-330(C) and ARS sec 49-444(A). Second publication will occur 
a week later. We will research and confirm the mechanics for getting the 
notices published as soon as possible after the Tuesday, October 9 conference 
call; ADEQ will promptly prepare the form of notice, unless you wish TWP to 
do it.
4. On Tuesday, November 13, ADEQ will conduct the public hearing on the two 
permit revisions in Williams AZ. We have found nothing in the statutes or 
rules that would prevent having back-to-back hearings for the Kingman and 
Flagstaff facilities' permits revisions in the same place.
5. Promptly after the October 9 conference call that finalizes the draft 
permits revisions, ADEQ will send the drafts to EPA Region IX to commence 
EPA's review. TWP will confer with the EPA contacts to shorten the maximum 45 
days allowed so that EPA will complete its review on or before Thursday, 
November 15; EPA will promptly notify ADEQ of its approval.
6. On the assumption that neither the public hearing nor the EPA review 
generated any substantive comments that require further review, ADEQ will 
issue the permits revisions by Friday, November 16.
We recognize that the foregoing schedule will require significant cooperation 
among all parties, as well as working closely with EPA, but we are confident, 
based upon yesterday's meeting, that all of us from ADEQ and from TWP are 
committed to making this doable schedule work. The TWP team will promptly 
convey to ADEQ all materials it receives relating to the EPA permits 
revisions for the Leupp and Klagetoh facilities.
We also appreciated your clarification of the facilities-related activities 
that we can proceed with prior to final permits issuance. Specifically, since 
there will be no emissions impacts from the routine maintenance of replacing 
equipment and making the srubbers' tie-ins, TWP can proceed with those 
activities at the Kingman and Flagstaff sites. Additionally, we can proceed 
with the off-site fabrication of piping.
We also understand that, at the time of the first newspaper notices, we will 
post the appropriate signs at each facility duplicating the newspaper notices.
Again, thank you very much for your assistance in setting up the foregoing 
schedule and procedures. It is a real pleasure working together to improve 
Arizona's air quality.
Sincerely yours,
Jerry D. Martin

Fred is anxious to get something to the counterparty - his preference is  yesterday.
I would think that a discussion with Fred about the deal might be  in order today, even if by phone.
What is your availability?
John/Carolyn,  have you had a chance to review the draft I sent you, and do you have any  notions about how to structure this deal?
Is the format ok?
Can we  make it  more seller friendly without being ridiculous?
When the initial draft is ready, it will need to go to Matt Gockerman (ENA  Tax) and Herman Manis (structuring accountant).

Will do.  With regard to storage, we will proceed on the assumption that you 
will not want to query any period longer than the previous calendar month and 
thus will not store any data that is more than 45 days old.

Subject: Further to your report
Jeff:
If further conversations with our technical folks, they have a suggestion 
which I believe increases the flexibility of this report and a key question 
which helps determine the resources required to support it.
First the suggestion.  If the report is designed to run with a Start date and 
End date, you will be able to pick the reporting period.  For example a 
particular week, a calendar month, the latest four weeks, etc.  This would be 
in lieu of the more structured (hard coded) format in my e-mail of 
yesterday.  I recommend this option.
Second the question.  How far back in time do you want to query?   60 days?  
90 days?
There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report.  Each 
product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time, 
bid price, bid volume, offer price, offer volume.  All of this data will need 
to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query.   By limiting the 
amount of time the data is kept, we can minimize the amount of data storage 
resources required to support this report.
Please let me know your thoughts.
Thanks!
-Bob"

Subject: Texas Grid Becomes Unified
Body: 
Electrical Grid Becomes Unified as Texans Start to Get Choice of Providers
Source: Austin American-Statesman 
Publication date: 2001-06-01
Arrival time: 2001-06-04
Jun. 1--After years of careful negotiation and planning, the pilot program 
for Texas' competitive retail electricity market starts today -- more or 
less. 
The state agencies responsible for ensuring the reliability of the 
electricity grid are phasing in customer changes more slowly than first 
planned to make sure Texas isn't beset by errors that could cause the type of 
power outages routine in parts of California. 
""As the systems testing started, it became clear it would take a little 
longer to get the systems in place,"" said Terry Hadley, a spokesman for the 
state Public Utility Commission. 
Though the pilot program involves at most 5 percent of the customers of 
utilities that are entering the competitive market, it will be closely 
watched as a test of whether the full program will work when it starts Jan. 
1. The delay won't mean much in practice; -- customers who switch to a new 
provider probably will get their first new bill in August rather than July. 
The delay comes as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc., which 
manages the statewide grid, moves from a system of 10 regional power controls 
to a unified system. ERCOT, as the agency is called, today is scheduled to 
dedicate its new, 45,000-square-foot facility near Austin-Bergstrom 
International Airport. 
""We're making progress every day,"" ERCOT Chief Executive Tom Noel said in a 
statement. ""We want to be fast, but we insist on getting it right. These are 
complex computer and communications systems, and we need to take some time to 
test and debug them."" 
ERCOT is one of the three big power grids in the United States and the only 
one contained to one state. Its 37,000 miles of transmission lines cover 
about 85 percent of Texas. The Panhandle and South Plains areas in Northwest 
Texas and parts of East and Southeast Texas are connected to the other grids. 
ERCOT is akin to a railroad switching station, making sure that power can 
move from plants to consumers through a network of transmission lines and 
connection facilities. 
The advantage of a self-contained grid works only if enough power is 
generated and there are enough transmission lines to move it. Twenty-two 
plants have opened since 1995. Deregulation advocates say the power-plant 
building binge should ensure adequate power for Texas. 
The new ERCOT system is expected to be able to handle about 21,000 customer 
switches each day by July 6. Switching a customer to a new provider should 
take about two weeks. 
The deregulated market for electricity works like long-distance telephone 
service. Customers of publicly held utilities such as Reliant Energy Inc. and 
TXU Corp. can choose among providers serving their area, scouting for the 
cheapest price. TXU serves about 55,000 customers in Williamson and 
neighboring counties. The City of Austin is not required to open its market 
to competition and has not announced any intention of doing so. 
The pilot program has been very successful with large business and industrial 
customers, but only 53,000 residential customers statewide have signed up. 
Most of those were in Reliant's home base of Houston; the company is more 
than halfway to the 5-percent mark. TXU has filled about 20 percent of the 
slots available for residential customers, virtually all in the Dallas-Fort 
Worth area, while other companies have only had a few people switch. 
Marketing has been focused on major cities, Hadley said, and companies that 
primarily serve more rural areas have not necessarily found it worthwhile to 
get the word out at this point. 
Several consumer-advocate groups filed a petition with the PUC last week, 
claiming that even when the information gets out, it is often misleading, 
confusing or incomplete. 
Some customers in outlying areas say the effort it takes to get the 
information makes switching hardly worth it. 
Frank Mathewson of Round Rock said he requested a list of retail electric 
providers for his area, which is served by TXU, from the state's deregulation 
initiative, the PUC's Power to Choose program. 
""They were supposed to have sent me information on everybody, and I have 
never gotten any,"" he said. ""After a while, I'll just give up.""

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/10/00  and  
the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:
'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
""Daily Change' worksheet.

Hi Mark,
Attached is a Service Level Agreement for our deal with Global View Software.  Forthcoming will be two attachments - one that gives EOL contact names and numbers and one that outlines the hardware in detail.  I assume that neither will have any bearing on the SLA.  We would like to see it turned around in a week or so if at all possible.  Global View actually has the hardware and we are in the middle of some user acceptance testing.  Please give me a call if any questions.

Wicku,
I hoped to hear from you. Please, let me know whether your plans have
changed, and if so, when you are coming to Palo Alto.
I spent theer weeks in Europe in September (had dinner with Leszek and Ewa),
and went to Sydney as a guest of NBC. Upon return I caught a flu, and
travelled heavily congested to New York, which led to some ear
problems.Consequently I intend to stay put for several weeks, and will have
to reschedule my trip to Houston for Dec. or January. Hope to see you here
before then.
Best to all three of you.

Jeff,
Thank you for the referral of the Citizens Kingman, Arizona project to Enron 
Asset Management Resources (EAMR), the new ETS service company, for further 
development.  We appreciate your willingness to ""stay in the loop"" with the 
project since you have the relationship with the customer.  
It is not often that we have the opportunity to take over the operation of a 
facility before in-service.  This is a great opportunity to operate assets 
that do not have a long and potentially risky environmental history, so we 
are excited about this opportunity.
This bid proposal is envisioned to be a joint effort between Operations and 
Market Services to:
Identify the functions required to perform the requested services
Price the delivered services
Identify the risks associated with performing the services 
Mitigate and/or price in adequate compensation for the risks
As the project is kicked off, we enter the information gathering stage to 
determine the configuration of the facility and the service requirements.
I have placed a call to Citizens to initiate this effort and will keep you 
informed of developments.
Julia, 
I am assuming that Donna Scott will be the primary contact for this joint 
development and that she will coordinate Market Service's efforts, therefore, 
she is copied on this e-mail.  Let me know if you have any changes to this 
approach.

		 Subject: Citizens request for proposal
Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 
Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we ""share"" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 
Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions."

Mark Lay:  Again, thank you for listening to my concept.  In my search for 
co-foounder/collaborators and
angel investors, disclosing the concept (for lack of a better title now, I 
call the system ""LifeTrak"")
and formulating a simple, clear picture is not easy.  The attached schematic 
depicts an overview of the
effort.  Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as 
participants and member
organizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.  
The groups fall into two
natural sectors;  (1) supply generators; and (2) user/service organizations.  
In the middle is the system
and its management that interconnects those benefiting groups and the 
donor/recipient LifeTrak
cardholders.  I can embellish more on these later.  The diagram gives us a 
place to begin discuss and
talking points in order to try to simplify how the concept could be developed 
and supported and where the
revenue model which creates dramatic efficiencies generates management and 
license fee.  I hope we can
get together soon.  Although Vince Kaminski cannot directly contribute due to 
his other commitments, I
have copied him to keep him advised (hoping that he might be able to do more 
at a later date.).  Best

Subject: Re: PowerGen - Urgent
Body: 
This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North 
American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those 
portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying 
those provisions which are subject to the masters.  In my view there are 
really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.  Most of 
the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent 
there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured 
interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.  In one case I 
had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by 
paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow 
the master to control.  The only sections we had to amend were the first 
sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in 
the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of 
section 6(e).  And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has 
insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or 
another.
Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to 
the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and 
use of the website.  In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual 
trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, 
perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like ""Except as set forth under 
paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA 
and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe 
master agreement shall prevail.
If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would 
be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to ""The agreements listed beloweach
comprises a"" or better yet ""Each agreement listed below is a"" rather than 
""The agreements listed below comprise the"".

Dave,
I'm trying to reach agreement with PowerGen re: EOL trades - they are still 
very concerned with the overriding effect of the ETA, and will not accept our 
position.
However, I have managed to get somewhere..........and I attach a draft I 
propose to send to their lawyer.  This is I believe as far as we can get with 
PowerGen (I did speak to him and I don't think he will go any further than as 
set forth in the draft).  The key point for me was to get PowerGen to agree 
(which I think they will) that the short + long descriptions [key elements of 
any trade] prevail over the master.
Thoughts, comments please....
My view - if PowerGen agrees the draft, that should give us sufficient 
comfort...
Thanks
Justin"

S.A. VAN VACTOR
Energy Crisis Myths
Mythology has always been an important part of the
human experience and never more so than when hard
choices must be made. Thus it should come as no
surprise that our current energy crisis is accompanied by
a seemingly endless array of apologies, exaggerations,
and myths.
Far and away the most common myth concerns the
persistent view of many that suppliers are holding back
generation in order to jack up prices. Similar charges
were levied during the oil crises of the 1970s. In those
days, critics complained that tankers could be seen just
off the coast, waiting until prices rose. Holding back on
electricity sales makes even less sense because once a
moment of demand has passed, it is gone forever. No
rational supplier will turn down the price offers persisting
in the present marketplace day after day. Indeed, most
suppliers are laboring to squeeze out every electron
possible from aging and unreliable generators.
An equally common error arises when the crisis is
blamed on ""deregulation"" and free markets. Although
California was the first state to adopt wide-scale
consumer choice, its market has been heavily regulated
and constrained. For example, after nearly three years
of consumer choice in the retail market only 12% of the
total volume is served by entities other than traditional
utilities. The volume of direct access has actually
declined in recent months as buyers have scrambled to
reconnect to regulated utilities that offer frozen rates.
More importantly, the development of reliable forward
markets and planning was stillborn because the
California Public Utility Commission either prohibited or
limited such trading at the same time that it granted
automatic ""prudency"" to spot purchases. Deregulation
may have changed the nature of the crisis, from a
physical to a financial problem, but the demand and
supply fundamentals at the heart of the current energy
crises were inherited from an earlier era of regulatory
stumbles.
Officials in neighboring states are eager to blame
California for the crisis, but nothing could be further from
the truth. The Western power market is fully
interconnected by design and if one part is short, all
regions are short. In fact, every operating area
recognized that demand would occasionally exceed
supply; planners simply relied on the proposition that it
would not happen simultaneously in all regions of the
West. However, this is exactly what has happened.
The current crisis was precipitated by a scarcity of
natural gas, unexpected demand growth in California
and the Southwest, the second hottest summer on
record in the Southwest, and low water runs in Northern
California and the Pacific Northwest.
If these myths are at odds with reality, how should the
energy crisis be viewed? Famine and pestilence are
normally reserved for biblical parables, but they do play
a role in this story. The Western power market is tied to
the vast generation potential of the region's hydroelectric
system. The system's potential is not, however, always
available. Unlike hydro systems in Quebec and Brazil,
the Columbia River system has only three months worth
of water storage. (Quebec is said to have ten years of
water inventory). The difference between a drought and a
year flush with water can be as high as 6,000 average
megawatts per hour - roughly the capacity of six of the
West's nuclear generating stations. Thus, the availability
of electricity swings from abundance to scarcity in an
unpredictable pattern based on the state of the region's
rivers. In the key months of June and July this year,
hydroelectric generation from the Northwest Power Pool
averaged 4,635 megawatts per hour below that of the
favorable year of 1997.
System planners in the 1970s understood the nature of
the hydroelectric system very well and planned to add
thermal generation facilities to ensure adequate supply
even under ""critical-water"" conditions. These conditions
represented the worst-case scenario for hydroelectric
generation. Such planning, however, renders most
prospective thermal plants uneconomic, because they
would lay idle except under the driest of conditions. With
the collapse of the WPPSS plants, the Pacific Northwest
quietly shifted its planning criteria from critical water to
average water. In times of heavy water flow the region is
a net exporter, but during a drought, it must import
electricity.
Over the last decade, utility planning has been replaced
by a market, and not just in California. Almost all new
generators are independent power producers. In a
market, new supply will only be built if there is the
incentive to do so. That incentive takes the form of
profits, and profits arise through high prices. What no one
has thought through is the implications of the variability of
hydro-electric power on the incentive to construct thermal
generation. If new thermal generation is constructed, but
is only needed one out of every ten years, then prices in
years of drought must be extremely high in order to make
building such thermal plants attractive to investors. In
short, this is what the western power market is
experiencing this year, and will continue to experience
until water flows improve and new supplies catch up with
the region's overall economic growth.
The first step in solving a problem is to understand its
cause. While it is true that California and other Western
states have not invested sufficiently in generation
capacity and natural gas delivery systems, additional
supply is not, by itself, the answer. Politicians, planners,
and market participants alike must recognize that drought
years will produce power shortages, and they should plan
accordingly. The extremely high prices observed this last
month arise, in part, from fear that the Pacific Northwest
may be entering a cycle of cold, dry weather. So far the
reaction has been uneven and not terribly productive.
Instead of blaming suppliers or each other, the region's
leaders should implement energy conservation programs
aimed at solving a short-term, not just a long-term
problem. Publicity that explains the situation with the aim
of conservation among consumers, ""buy-back"" programs
for industrial and commercial customers, and other such
pricing incentives should be implemented as rapidly as
possible, before low water forces everyone into rolling
blackouts and manufacturing curtailments.

Subject: MTBE legislation
Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  
We expect it to include:  
1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance""
Brief analysis:  
We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  
As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance"" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).
An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.
The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.
One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.
I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Hi Mike, 
I am an account manger in the San Ramon, CA office.  I am also an MBA 
student.  I am currently taking a class in marketing and my group will be 
doing a presentation on E-commerce and how it is affecting the way businesses 
are marketing to their customers (and even how they decide what customers to 
market to).  I came across your powerpoint presentation on the EnronOnline 
website and found the information to be extremely relevant and useful to what 
we plan on covering.  Would it be possible to get a copy of that presentation 
from you?  Also, would you be able to provide more insight on how you feel 
the internet has made an impact on the energy industry?  I recently heard 
that a couple of other utilities (I believe Duke and Sempra) are also putting 
together plans for e-commerce websites.  What are your thoughts on that?
Any insight and information you could provide would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks, 
Renee Fernandez"

of Elektro until its ultimate sale.
The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=

=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=

in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.
These groups include:
The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=

                      RECRUITING: JUCO LB says OU will be tough to beat
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 26, 2001
                      The latest on San Francisco junior college linebacker
Lance Mitchell's visit to
                      Norman
                     LANCE MITCHELL, MLB, 6'3, 243, 4.5, SAN FRANCISCO C.C,
CALIFORNIA:
                     JH: How did your visit to OU this weekend go?
                     LM: Oklahoma was real good and I had a great time.
Oklahoma has a need for
                     linebackers and that is important to me. The people
were great and the town was
                     super. Being from LA, many people told me that I
wouldn't like a small town like
                     Norman, but that wasn't true. Norman seems to be a
great town and a great town
                     that I could live in. My host was Roy Williams and he
is a great guy. He showed us
                     a little Cali love!
                     JH: What did you think of the OU defense?
                     LM: I loved the defensive scheme. I loved the people
that were on the field that
                     would be back if I went to Oklahoma. I liked the
coaches and how they went about
                     their business. I think I would fit in real well with
them.
                     JH: What did you think of the way OU plays it's middle
linebacker?
                     LM: It is designed for that player in the middle to
make the plays. Either you do or
                     you don't, but you have every opportunity to make the
plays.
                     JH: Roy Williams was the host, how did you enjoy our
visit with him?
                     LM: Roy was pretty depressed about the game, but I was
pretty mad to. We went
                     to a party that night and just hung out. We didn't do
all that much, but we had a
                     great time, because he was such a great guy and all the
players we met were
                     super. Roy is a super person and so are the rest of the
guys as well.
                     JH: Did you come close to committing to OU?
                     LM: I promised my mom I wouldn't commit and I didn't,
but I really enjoyed the
                     visit. However, if signing day was tomorrow I would
sign with OU. OU is out in front
                     of the schools that I have visited thus far. I was
supposed to visit Texas this
                     weekend, but that changed, because they will play for
the Big 12 title. However, I
                     don't know if I am going to visit Texas or not, because
I am finding out they have
                     a lot more depth and commitments than they have been
telling me about. I will
                     visit Florida on December 14th.
                     JH: What did you think of the game?
                     LM: Being a fellow football player I can tell when the
better team isn't winning. That
                     is what happened Saturday. The offense never really got
it going and that happens
                     sometimes. You can't leave your defense on the field
for the whole game. If OU
                     played them 10 times I am not sure OU wouldn't win the
next ten. I my opinion,
                     OU played a bunch of cheerleaders and lost, but it
won't happen again.
                     JH: What did you think of the atmosphere?
                     LM: It's was great and I would love to play in front of
that.
                     JH: Would it take a super visit from one of the teams
ahead for you not
                     to come to OU?
                     LM: I am a shy guy, yet I had so much fun there. The
people were just so nice to
                     me and made me relax and be myself. That is so
important to me and OU has that
                     naturally. can't see anybody beating OU at this point.

                      RECRUITING: Jackson enjoys visit to Norman
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 26, 2001
                      Junior college linebacker Pasha Jackson talks about
his trip to Norman this
                      weekend
                     PASHA JACKSON, SLB, 6'3, 235, 4.5, SAN FRANCISCO C.C.,
CALIFORNIA:
                     JH: How was your trip to OU?
                     PJ: The trip was excellent, even though they had a
tough game. The chemistry
                     between players and coaches was excellent. I loved
everything about the trip,
                     except for the game, because I was wanting Oklahoma to
win. I really enjoyed
                     watching Coach (Brent) Venables because he is a very
intense, positive guy and I
                     like that. I could tell he is a great coach, which
means a lot to me, because I will
                     be spending most of my time with him.
                     JH: Did Lance like the trip as well?
                     PJ: Lance and I talked about the trip all the way back
on the plane. He had nothing
                     but positive things to say about OU as well. We both
feel that we both can see
                     nothing but positives about both us going to OU.
                     JH: Did you almost commit to OU on the trip?
                     PJ: OU made committing more tempting that any other
visit thus far. We were
                     close to committing, but I feel I need to take my other
visits so that I know for
                     sure who my best school is going to be. I am not
committing, but OU is looking
                     pretty good. Without question they are the best school
that we have visited thus
                     far.
                     JH: What did you think of the OU defense?
                     PJ: I like OU's defense. I feel I would fit in at the
SLB position when they are in
                     their standard defense, but I can also play in their
nickel. Because I can play in the
                     nickel and have a linebacker type body on the field,
that would help their run
                     support, which is important in a conference like the
Big 12. It would enhance the
                     defense, because I am a bigger and stronger player, yet
I can easily help in pass
                     coverage.
                     JH: What did you think of Norman?
                     PJ: A lot of my people are from Louisiana and the
surrounding area, so I know
                     about that part of the country. Granted, Norman is not
like Los Angeles, but it is
                     not small town either. You can have a lot of fun in
Norman and have a good quality
                     of life. The people are real down to earth and are very
nice. When Lance and I
                     went to your radio show the people were so down to
earth that it touched us,
                     because they were so kind to two total strangers. I
could easily live in Norman.
                     JH: What is up next for you in recruiting?
                     PJ: I am going to visit my next two schools, which are
Arizona and South Carolina,
                     but going into those visits OU is way out in front.

                      BASKETBALL RECRUITING: Kevin Bookout update
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 25, 2001
                      The latest on six-foot-seven Stroud power forward
Kevin Bookout
                     KEVIN BOOKOUT, 6'7, STROUD, OKLAHOMA:
                     There is still nothing official to report on whether
Bookout signed with OU or not.
                     Bookout told me tonight he will make an official
statement on the subject
                     Wednesday or Thursday.
                     Here are my thoughts from what I have been able to
gather as facts.
                     1) I have no doubts that Bookout is going to be a
Sooner. The question is in which
                     sport ? basketball or track ? or both? I believe that
Bookout has singed with the
                     OU basketball program, but what I don't know is if OU
has turned in the papers or
                     not.
                     2) The reason that I am not sure if the papers are in
or not is because Bookout is
                     struggling with the question of just competing in track
or playing both basketball
                     and track in college. Plus, there has been no official
announcement. If OU never
                     turns in the papers, then it is just like he didn't
sign.
                     3) If Bookout just decides to pursue track and field at
OU then he needs to sign a
                     scholarship with the OU track program, because you must
participate with the
                     program you sign with your freshman season. If he is
going to play both sports at
                     OU then OU hoops will turn in those scholarship papers
if they can, or they will
                     resign him in the spring.
                     4) The U.S.A. Olympic committee is putting a lot of
pressure on Bookout to just
                     compete in track and field. They don't care if he goes
to OU or not, but they want
                     him to just concentrate on the shot and discus. They
certainly have Bookout's ear
                     at the moment. However, he has told the OU basketball
coaches several times
                     over the past few days that he wants to play basketball
and then he talks to U.S.A.
                     Track and gets confused.
                     5) I believe when this is all said and done that
Bookout will play both sports at OU.
                     It may mean that he has to resign with OU hoops again
in the spring, but then
                     again maybe the fact he has already signed in the fall
will count in some way. So,
                     this isn't totally in the books yet, except that I know
Bookout is going to OU. I just
                     don't know if it is to play both basketball and
track-and-field or just participate in
                     track."

Subject: Fly Alaska and Earn Free Electronics
Body: 
HAVE YOU EARNED FREE ELECTRONICS YET?
If you have flown or are planning on flying Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air
between October 1, 2000 and December 15, 2000 you could earn up to $1,500
in free electronics from etown.com, the premier online consumer
electronics source.
HOW? IT'S EASY - JUST READ BELOW
1) Sign up with a new MyAlaskaAir account at www.alaskaair.com  before
December 15.  A MyAlaskaAir account speeds you through alaskaair.com when
you want to book and purchase online.  It allows you to securely and
conveniently store preference information such as favorite destinations,
seating choice, contact information, even your billing credit card if you
choose.  It's free, takes only minutes, AND you'll earn 1,000 Mileage Plan
bonus miles just for signing up.  Make sure you include your Alaska
Airlines Mileage Plan number to qualify for this promotion.
2) Fly Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air between October 1, 2000 and December
15, 2000 and earn Miles on your Mileage Plan account as you would
normally.  It doesn't matter how you book or purchase your tickets (you
don't have to purchase online to qualify).  Every segment you earn will
count toward your etown.com certificate award amount.  The etown.com
certificates will be e-mailed to you in mid February.
Every round-trip you fly is at least two segments, so frequent flyers can
rack up free electronics fast.  BUT REMEMBER, no matter how many Mileage
Plan flight miles you earn, you have to sign up with a new MyAlaskaAir
account (and include your Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan number) by December
15, 2000 to qualify!
This is how many dollars-off etown.com merchandise you can earn:
Alaska or Horizon Segments / etown.com credit
3-5 / $25
6-10 / $50
11-15 / $150
16-20 / $300
21-30 / $600
31+ / $1,500
So, get that MyAlaskaAir account, rack up Mileage Plan miles, and in
February you can shop for your dream electronics item.  Go to
www.alaskaair.com for full details.  Don't forget to visit www.etown.com
to start planning your purchase!

Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and

best way to value, and book, real options fairly?

Body: 
Thank you. =20
On the SDEC:=20
this is no longer an '02 play.  To keep it as an '03 play three things need=
 to happen:
(1) we need to move our application for an Unusual Use Permit from the juri=
sdiction of the Community Zoning Appeals Board (""CZAB"") to the Board of Cou=
nty Commissioners.  The CZAB is a parochial board that is stacked with NIMB=
Y's.  We have been doing our assessment of the communities and after weeks =
of investigation we have concluded that if we go before the CZAB, we feel w=
e will be facing sudden death.  However, if we go before the County Commiss=
ioners, we will have a very good chance of success.  The vehicle we propose=
 to use to change the jurisdiction is something called an Application of Ve=
sted Rights. As I understand it, (I'm getting info on this today), this is =
a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any use=
 of his property.  This application needs to be submitted to the county bef=
ore June 6th, the date of our CZAB hearing.=20
(2) we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of=
 Environmental Resources Management (""DERM"") who is responsible for ensurin=
g that the land fill be closed.  They have been pushing the owner of the pr=
operty to initiate the closure work.  The land owner, Certrosa Holdings,  i=
s a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela.   If we wer=
e not in the picture, I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default=
 on the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up =
(at $3 to 4 million). To keep this as an '03 play we will need to get DERM =
to agree to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we wi=
ll need provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get i=
n the chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landf=
ill. We may need to initiate this conversation in the next 2 to 3 weeks.
(3) we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September.=
  The strike price for this property is approximately $1.3 million and we p=
aid $200,000 for a 9 month option last October (when the rules were soft co=
sts could not exceed 5% of the total project cost of $175 million).  Based =
on the success of (1) and (2) above, we may need to initiate this discussio=
n in the next 2 to 3 weeks as well.
On the Medley - Dunn discussions:
As you know, when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns, last month, they =
had two deal breakers: (a) they wanted a committment on our part that we wo=
uld pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax abatemen=
t.  (we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town would not =
involve the Dunns) (b) they wanted us to assume all past and present enviro=
nmental liabilities.  We said no to both conditions and halted discussions.=
  I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns that they =
are considering giving on both these items.  If we structured an arrangemen=
t where we did a phase 2 environmental assessment during a 60 to 90 day ""du=
e diligence"" period (rather than in an option period or under a 90 day leas=
e), gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the result=
s of the phase 2; and, we change the agreement back to the way it was in th=
e last Andrew &  Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical en=
vironmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise =
in the future but are not the result of our operations.  Would this arrange=
ment give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if necessary =
to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any clean up?=
  If this is something we can work with, we need to have a conversation wit=
h the Dunn's attorney.  What do you think?

I spoke to Narshima about this deal.  EESI would be bid at $46.00/MWD for Unforced Capacity Credits for Cal02.  Are you asking if we would have a bid for the energy as well?  If so, I would need to know the specific location for this generator (i.e. what point does this energy enter the PJM system).

Spread the Word 
You are the reason that we have experienced such strong growth this past year.  Most people find out about us because someone like you has told them about us (that's a lot of pronouns).  Please keep telling your friends.  Also, if you have a favorite restaurant/bar that doesn't carry our beer, let us know.  If you manage to sell it in, let us know and we will reward you! 
Anyone Seen our Cable TV Ads? 
We have been running some ads on the Optel/Showcase cable network.  We are curious if anyone has seen them.  If so, please let us know (along with any comments).  Did you suddenly experience the uncontrollable urge to open a cold St. Arnold?

I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury.  She indicated that we are currently
working with Chase Bank and City Bank for our third party escrow
Agreements.  Mary will forward Kay and I electronic copies of both of their
standard agreements.  The timeline for a standard agreement is at least 3
days and increases with the level of complexity of the Escrow Agreement's
terms & conditions.  The cost for either bank to set-up and administer the
escrow would be approximately $5-$10K, with additional cost if the
Agreement was overly complex.
Kay:  Call me to discuss our proposed Escrow Agreement T&C's and how a
draft form of this Agreement should be best incorporated into the
transaction documents.  At a minimum, we should attach it as a sample form
and have the Letter Agreement(s) contain ""substantially in conformance

Stan felt it would be appropriate for the Policy Committee to review the 
attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  
In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of 
the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management 
(Lemmons):
? Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is 
where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure 
consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final 
PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the 
names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
? The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of 
representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions 
were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure 
fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC 
Committee.  
? An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion 
criteria.
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by 
mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the 
memo distribution list that evening.
Regards,
Billy"

Jeff,
With little physical knowledge of the transmission and generation 
constraints, etc., it's going to be difficult for me to say, geographically, 
where I think the boundaries ought to be.  However, I think the market would 
always prefer a simple layout, something like MISO - West, - Central, - East, 
- South.  To me, I think that would cover the basic areas that trade 
differently in terms of price.

Subject:  Presentation to Skilling etc.
Mike,
As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:
1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but
we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a ""maybe"".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing ""mistakes"".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss
it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed
a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a ""water piece"" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow ""up"" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently
hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Lea

In that case, it's just the SoCalGas core procurement charge (including
brokerage fee -- e.g. their March price was $7.404/dth) that we need to be
comparable to or beat.  We have more control over the transmission rates so 
the
price from Enron we are looking for is just for the commodity at the border.
I'll provide you with our monthly WACOG that customers are charged as the
commodity portion of their bill versus SoCalGas' core procurement charge.  
I'll
be sending you the data today.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes
Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation, in an Advisory
by Industrialinfo.com
    Business/Energy Editors
	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston): The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants, which
could represent part of the answer to world's power generation needs
over the next 30 years, has taken a few steps forward in the
consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months.
However, nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental
groups and those involved with post-Chernobyl public health concerns.
	   The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) from Eskom in South Africa
continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry
regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the
modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and
appropriate.
	   Stakeholders in the project include the U.S. company Exelon with
12.5%, Eskom with 30%, British Nuclear Fuels with 22.5%, Industrial
Development Corporation of SA with 25%, and Black empowerment at 10%.
Currently, Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of 40 PBMRs
at a price of around $6 billion (USD). Early in 2001 the company
requested the U.S. National Regulatory Commission to start laying the
groundwork for PBMR licensing.
	   Exelon would like to see the $300 million demonstration unit,
which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model, to show
that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety,
efficiency and viability are proven enough for U.S. regulatory
agencies to proceed forward with licensing. The plant is to be built
alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape
Province of South Africa with work commencing in 2003. If approved,
Exelon may then start concurrent construction of U.S. sites to bring
PBMR-generated power to market at the earliest possible date and at
the best price. Specifications and claims by Eskom, who purchased the
technology after a 21-year development and proving period in Germany,
present the PBMR as small, safe, clean, cost efficient, inexpensive
and adaptable.
	   The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in
graphite to form a fuel sphere (60mm in diameter). The PBMR design
makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a
closed cycle gas turbine and generator. The design differences between
the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a
safe and economical power plant.
	   The annual world market for power generation is estimated at $70
billion. The PBMR, if it comes through its regulatory trials, would be
in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action. With 10%
of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black
empowerment shareholders, 10 plant export orders a year could
contribute nearly $1 billion a year to South Africa's Gross Domestic
Product and another $1 billion in export income. An estimated 57,000
direct and indirect jobs would be created. These figures would double
and triple for 20 or 30 orders annually. If the demo plant achieves
its targets, Eskom will place an order for 10 modules, with the Exelon
order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the
first U.S. plant in 2007.
	   Eskom will sell PBMR's as a manufactured item with no rights
given. Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured
reactor and 20% site construction related. The aim is for 40% of the
sourcing to come from South Africa. Taxpayers money (approximately $50
million so far) is being spent by the South African authorities in
giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the
project before the ""go"" decision is given. With this right and proper
concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the
130MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of
nuclear power generation.
	   The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their
ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a
significant move. A contract has been placed (in mid-January 2002)
with the U.S. company Stone & Webster and South African construction
company Murray & Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman
Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project
in engineering, procurement, construction management and project
management. Following this development, the PBMR management at Eskom
have gone on record to state that with the multi-national and
multi-disciplinary support now providing leverage, the approval
hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of 2002
given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the
government.

Tana-
We have a few counterparties that have been in the work queue for a while.  
When you get a chance, would you mind taking a look at the counterparties 
listed below:
Cascades Inc.
Capital Paper Recycling, Inc.
Storm Mountain Publishing Company
Jeffrey Acquisition Group
Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd.
NLK Consultants Inc.
Plateau Forest Products, Inc.
Southwest Paper Stock Inc.
We also need to get together and go through the work queue again for a few 
old counterparties I still see on the list.  Give me a call when you get a 
chance and we can run through that.
Thanks Tana!

Dear Vince,
Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 
Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 
Sincerely,
Jim Garven

Stinson,
Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills. 
We might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through

I spoke to Alan Kent from the Title Company this morning,  He was there
signing the Contract and I assume depositing the $20,000 balance of earnest
money.  I reminded him that we were looking to him to acquire and pay for
the Survey.  He indicated that would not be a problem.
As soon as the Commitment for Title Insurance is issued and the Survey
completed a closing date will be set.

Press Release
FuelCell Energy Signs First North American Distribution Agreement With PPL 
EnergyPlus
Strategic Distribution Alliance to Advance Sales of Fuel Cell Products for 
Distributed Generation Market
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 21, 2000-- FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
(NASDAQ: FCEL - news) has selected PPL EnergyPlus, LLC, a subsidiary of PPL 
Corp. (NYSE: PPL - news), as the first North American distributor of its 
Direct FuelCell(TM)(DFCc) products for the distributed generation market. The 
agreement facilitates commercialization of FuelCell Energy's DFCc products, 
which will be available for submegawatt commercial orders in the second half 
of 2001, and megawatt commercial orders in 2002. In addition, PPL has made an 
equity investment of approximately $10 million, or about one per cent of 
FuelCell Energy's equity and will order 1.25 megawatts of commercial field 
trial units in the next six months. 
In announcing the strategic alliance between the two firms, Jerry Leitman, 
president and CEO of FuelCell Energy, said, ``We're delighted to have PPL, a 
leading supplier of competitively priced electricity and energy services in 
the mid-Atlantic region, as our first distribution partner in North America. 
PPL is a successful company, with a solid growth strategy, and is highly 
qualified to penetrate the market for distributed generation solutions, 
through their energy marketing and services arm, PPL EnergyPlus. This 
agreement is the latest milestone attained in bringing our products to the 
stationary power marketplace.'' 
The DFCc power plant is especially well suited for a variety of distributed 
generation applications, including high reliability and power quality, 
cogeneration, opportunity fuels, environmental compliance and grid 
congestion. PPL is targeting customers with these applications, including 
schools, hospitals, water treatment plants, office buildings and data 
centers. 
``We see enormous potential for this segment of our business,'' said William 
F. Hecht, PPL chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``As an 
innovative energy company, with a strong record of anticipating and meeting 
customer needs, this agreement is a natural step for PPL.'' 
For the initial order of 1.25 megawatts, FuelCell Energy will provide PPL 
with DFCc power plant engineering and operations experience. FuelCell Energy 
will manufacture the DFCc plants for the program and provide interface 
requirements. PPL will provide comprehensive power plant operations and 
maintenance (O&M) management services for the field trial power plants 
procured and/or sold by PPL. 
Using carbonate technology, FuelCell Energy Direct FuelCell(TM) power plants 
have nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW. The DFCc produces high 
efficiency energy through a chemical reaction, rather than through 
combustion, resulting in competitively priced electricity, with virtually no 
pollution. This revolutionary method of producing power gives energy users 
the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of 
environmental compliance, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for 
the permitting process. 
About FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a 
world-recognized leader for development and commercialization of high 
efficiency fuel cells for electric power generation. The Company's Direct 
FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel processing to extract hydrogen 
from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a product whose cost, combined with 
high efficiency, simplicity and reliability, results in product advantages 
for stationary power generation. FuelCell Energy is based in Danbury, Conn. 
The Company has been developing DFC technology for stationary power plants 
with the U.S. Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology 
Laboratory, whose advanced fuel cell research program is focused on 
developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate 
clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the 
customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and 
industrial applications.

Ben, please find attached revision two to the UAE - Lowell, Massachusetts 
LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility, which is to be located at an existing, 
staffed cogen facility. 
The second revisions are due to the following changes in assumptions:
1.  Further reduced the staffing costs due to no allocation of labor being 
assumed from existing plant to peaking plant and the addition of only ONE 
tech to cover the expansion O&M (per your discussion with UAE). 
2.  Restated the Annual Routine Maintenance costs components of FOM and VOM 
to 75% FOM and 25% VOM.
Please call if you have questions or want to discuss further.

Subject: Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy
Body: 
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.
Deal Terms
--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.
Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.
Management of Newly Formed Company
Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.
I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.
Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.
The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.
As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.
I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.
I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.
And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.
Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.
In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron."

Read JB's response to my phone call below.  I'm not sure what's going on but 
if you read the info I had sent to you (via intercompany mail), there are a 
number of questions which are relevant:
Why does M. Panelo's e-mail reference JB's ownership being 33%?
Why is JB's signature on the MOU Amendment?  What is his authority as a 
signatory?  If he's not an officer of this ""Ecogas S.A."" then why is his 
signature evidenced?
We're trying to track down the faxes he referenced below.  Once received, 
I'll forward them if they're pertinent.

Subject: Yesterday's discussion
Randy,
I am concerned about our conversation of yesterday morning.  I sent by fax
to you all relevant documents I have concerning any South American details
which have Ecogas involvement.  As stated over the phone and set out in the
documents, I have never had any ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint-venture, etc. for South America relating to Ecogas.  The
documents which you suggest you have cannot represent any such interest as
it does not and never has existed.  I simply would not act in that manner
and would have expected you to hold that understanding.
Given the status of Ecogas' operations currently I want to suggest that we
all direct our total efforts to resolution of that crisis, rather than
continuing personal distractions and devisiveness.
Regards,
Jerrel"

As the movement toward competition in North American retail markets remains 
uncertain, it is important to consider how opportunities may be evolving in 
Europe.
* European Union Directives will eventually make the electric and gas markets 
more integrated and open, creating a single market comparable to North 
America.
* Significant restructuring of assets and processes is mirroring US 
restructuring activity at the wholesale and retail levels, and in some areas 
moving faster.
* Currently, the only robust competitive retail gas and power market is in 
the United Kingdom, although other countries are technically open with some 
customer switching and still others are soon to follow.

 I would like to personally thank you for spending the day with us at the
MSCF program at Carnegie Mellon.  The time you spent talking to us about
Enron, and the energy industry in general, was very much appreciated.  In
fact, I believe some students who were not previously interested in energy
are now interested because of the things about which you spoke.  I have
signed up for an interview for the Associate program at Enron, and I hope to
speak to you again through involvement in the Associate program.  Thanks
again.

Gerald - I don't know exactly what I am doing these days and after lunch 
today,
I feel even more clueless.  I need you to know that I never wanted or thought 
in
a million years that this would be happening to us.  I also need you to know
that I have never felt so low, this is not easy for me AT ALL.  I can't bring
myself to sign the divorce papers.  This all seems so unreal to me.  I am 
sorry
I doubted your capacity to forgive me early on, but I just couldn't imagine 
that
you would ever be able to live with me again after knowing what I did.  I 
wish I
had done things differently and handled myself better.
It was good to see you and have a normal conversation like we used to.  I hope
you have a fun weekend.  See you Wednesday.

Subject: FERC RTO week:  Market Monitoring Session
Body: 
Participants:
-Prof. Charles Cicchetti, Univ. of Southern California
-Comm. Robert Nelson, Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm.
-Marji Phillips, Exelon Power Team (attorney)
-Sonny Popowski, PA Office of Consumer Advocate
-Craig Roach, Boston Pacific
-Anjali Sheffrin, Dir. Market Analysis, Cal ISO
Summary:  Market Monitor (MM) should be independent.  Too much MM transparency is a problem -- MM function should be done privately to FERC.  MM should be an early warning signal.
Specifics:
The morning started on a rather humorous note with Marji Phillips introducing herself as ""the guilty party so to speak in front of you"" (referencing the PECO/Exelon purported violation of standards of conduct).  She stated that it is not the role of the MM to interfere to make sure that power prices are the lowest in each hour -- the MM should monitor the RTO and the markets and be part of a creative solution (without imposing its own MM penalties/mitigation).  She used the Midwest price spikes of 98 as an example, and stated that a poor MM would probably have worsened the market solution that was reached without intervention.
Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not ""go to the farmer for costs.""  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.  
Many thought that there should be some standardization of the information provided to the MM.  Most agreed that the information should be provided on a confidential basis, especially before any specific problem has been found.
Sonny Popowski stated that the RTO must be truly independent or the MM simply catalogs the market failures.
Comm. Nelson said that the MM should have unfettered access to all costs and should have the ability for ""cease and desist"" orders.  Also, stated that ITCs/transcos should be monitored to the extent that they favor transmission solutions over DG and generation.  On the very positive side, he said RTO policy should proceed.
Ms. Sheffrin said that it would be simple to implement a rolling 12 month cost plus 10% competitive benchmark, and prices above this should be mitigated.  She said this would allow bidders to ""self police"" so as to not hit the benchmark.  Most of the others disagreed with her, pointing out that a simplistic test such as this does not account for market conditions.  It was pointed out that there were too many different MMs in Cal with no one acting.  Someone also commented that one reason participants did not want to turn data over to Cal ISO was because it was a contesting party.
All thought that DSM should be included in the market in order to be considered in mitigation.
Comm. Breathitt asked Ms. Sheffrin why the price cap wouldn't work in Cal.  She responded that the problems in Cal were with the need for LT contracts and other issues (she also said that it is not a zonal/lmp issue).  Importantly, she said that consumers are now conserving 3000-5000 MWs annually since getting the appropriate price signals.  Mr. Popowski said that he likes the price caps in PJM.  Margie countered and said that ""icap"" in PJM is the problem.  
FERC staff asked if the MM should monitor bilaterals.  Marji said absolutely not (between consenting companies and should not be unraveled).  Both agreed that the MM may at times need access to these in order to understand what was happening in the spot market."

My comments are as follows, and I'd like you to send a letter rather than an 
e-mail:
Dear Jeff,
As a follow up  to your letter dated May 9, 2001, upon the posting of an LC 
in the amount of $965,855 representing 5% of the price of unit 1, we are 
prepared to pay GE the $1,501,885 deducted from our last payment. With 
respect to liquidated damages on delivery of the air filter, we reserve our 
rights under the contract to exercise our offset rights at a later date.
Please let me know when you will be able to have the LC in place, and we will 
make appropriate payment arrangements.
Regards,
Chris Booth
Manager

Kay and Ben,
I would like to send the following to Jeff Darst at GE via e-mail.
Dear Jeff,
Pursuant to you letter dated May 9, 2001 we are prepared to pay the deduct 
for liquidated damages ($536,000) and retention deduct ($965,885) withheld 
from the April 25, 2001 invoice.  Payment of the deduct for the liquidated 
damages claim does not constitute a withdrawal of the claim, hence, we are 
not waiving our rights afforded under the contract.  As stated in our letter 
dated May 3, 2001, we are prepared to pay the final 5% payment for Unit 1 
upon receipt of the Letter of Credit for $965,855 (5% of the price for Unit 
1) and a lien release. 
Regards,

Enron is fine (although I think we have to pay for the Hyatt anyway).
?
Good discount (I have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the  
weather desk's idea is probably different?):? for the one day, $1100 per  
person.? If you think that there will be?around 10 people or more,  then we 
can offer a day rate, regardless of the number of people.? 
?
Thanks Vince

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to  pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.
I  contacted the weather desk about including other people at the  training
course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good  discount.

We just wanted to let you  know? that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather  derivatives course? (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple  more
that have expressed strong? interest, but we are awaiting their  final

it

(doing it at the Hyatt is an?  option as well but the room might be on the

can teach both days  as? well, but thought you may want to save some time.
I just  wanted to give? you some time to think about it. We will know where
we  stand on final? numbers by next?  Wednesday.

 <<IPW091001.doc>> 
Good Morning,
Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.
Also note that today and tomorrow (9/10 and 9/11), CSFB will host a Power
Generation Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.
This event is designed to provide investors with a wholistic perspective on
all aspects of the sector-from coal and natural gas companies, to equipment
and service providers, to the power producers themselves.  
The major power generators are scheduled to speak on Tuesday morning (9/11).
Between 9.25 am - 11.50 am presentations will be given by the following
companies: Aquila, Calpine, Mirant, NRG Energy, Orion Power, Reliant
Resources and TECO Energy.  
In addition, at 8 am on Tuesday there will be a panel discussion focusing on
the state of the generation market. 
Finally, at 12 pm on Tuesday Judah Rose a power market consultant with ICF
Consulting will offer his perspectives on the outlook for the sector during
a luncheon presentation.
Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 3.7%   Last week our IPP composite declined 3.7%, outperforming
both the NASDAQ (-6.5%) and the S&P 500 (-4.2%).  Shaw Group, which was up
14.4%, was the strongest performer in the group.  AES Corp was the weakest
performer, falling 10.7%.
2. Awaiting a Bottom   We attribute last week's stock price performance to
broader market concerns regarding the health of the macro economy and its
ability to recover by the end of 2001.  Our sense is that investors
recognize that IPP valuations are extremely attractive.  However, prior to
moving aggressively back into the sector, they await some indication that
stock prices have stabilized and a bottom has indeed been achieved.   
3. Shell Terminates Contract with CPN; Concerns Unwarranted   Following its
exit from the retail marketing business, Shell terminated a 5 year 3,000 MW
requirements contract with Calpine.  We believe some investors concluded
that this announcement had negative implication for CPN's earnings outlook
and its overall hedging strategy.  In our view these concerns are
unwarranted for 4 reasons: 1. The Shell contract was unusual; 2. There is no
earnings impact; 3. Remarketing the output will not be an issue; and, 4. The
status of CPN's hedging objectives is unaffected.
4. Legal and Administrative Issues Remain for California Windfall Profits
Tax Bills   Recently, two bills that would impose a windfall profits tax on
California generators have been advancing through the California legislature
and will likely by heard on the floor of the Assembly this week.  The
current legislative session will end this Friday (9/14), requiring any
pending bills to be passed by that time.  In our view these bills are best
understood as a negotiating tactic by Governor Gray Davis and Democrats in
the legislature designed to extract additional concession from the FERC and
the state's power generators.  While we expect at least one or both of these
bills to advance through the legislative process, full implementation is
likely to be prevented by a number of legal and administrative impediments.

Neil Stein 212/325-4217

Subject: Re: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio  
I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the ""killed"" 
feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular) 
in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to 
understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying 
to do that.
As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do 
that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success 
having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff 
through a few different channels of TS.  Even as we speak, I am running one 
report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one 
locally.  I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served 
me well.
I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.  I 
have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times.  
How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not a 
physical deal?
I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our 
collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life 
preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster 
to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.  It's not the 
best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.

Subject: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio
I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is 
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 
Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?
As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?
I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.
Thanks,
Kate

             Cara,
      I think the report should work that way even now.
     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.
       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.

The ""two sides of a cross-portfolio deal"" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.
Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when ""Desk to 
Desk"" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.
I don't think ""both sides"" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.
Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.
STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.
Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicaliti=
es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20
to capital.
The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

Kimberley,
Further to your email of this morning:
- I totally agree with the protocol approach for the Euro annexes
- As to the intention to change the approach for the other annexes, i.e.
develop a new master agreement:  as already indicated in my previous mail,
we support this approach
- As to the Tax Annex: we never seem to have seen a copy thereof. Could
you mail this to us?
Thanks and best regards,
Veerle Vercaigne

Body: 
OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look 
for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will 
present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the 
most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have 
them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout 
is as follows:
 Group1   Group2
 Carole    Jennifer
 Jason    Anne
 Chris   
Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 
11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.

Jinsung,
Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.
We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.
Here is the assumptions and the prices:
180MW
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
summer.
Prices are June-May yearly calculations
3yr $3.89kw-mo
5yr $3.84kw-mo
At this stage, the desk does not have a different price for the 4hr block 
product

Edith,
- Substation location: Sayerville
- Gas: Transco Zone 6 (no additional cost for LDC)
- Unit contingent call
- 97% availability: It should be OK since we can assume 97% during summer 
time and 90~93% during non-summer time, for example.
Could you get the pricing for following scenario based on above assumption?
Flat and annual capacity payment for 3 and 5 year
With 16 hour block and 4 hour block
Please call me, if it doesn't make sense.

Politics this week
October 25th 2001
From The Economist print edition 
Air raids
America's war against terrorism seemed to enter a new phase after details were released of a raid by airborne forces on a target inside Afghanistan, though expected follow-up attacks did not materialise. Air raids on the country continued: Taliban spokesmen claimed many civilian casualties. America admitted that some ""collateral damage"" may have occurred.
See article: Fighting terrorism <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31724_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4d>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
More anthrax
	
	 Reuters <http://www.economist.com/images/20011027/4301WW1.jpg>	
	
	
	
Two Washington postal workers, from the office that handled the contaminated letter sent to Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, died from inhalation anthrax, the most deadly form of the disease. Several other workers from the same office were suspected of having the disease, as was a worker from a sorting office in Trenton, New Jersey. Mass testing of postal workers began in Washington, DC, New Jersey and New York.
See article: Coping with the anthrax outbreak <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31723_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4c>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
Anthrax spores were also found in a military building that handles mail addressed to the White House. John Potter, the postmaster-general, said he could not guarantee that any American mail was safe.
See article: The postal service's troubles <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31722_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4b> 
Canada relented after threatening to circumvent a patent on Cipro, an antibiotic for the treatment of anthrax, and obtain supplies from a generic-drug company. Bayer, Cipro's maker, agreed to provide as much of the drug as Canada needed to allay public fears. The United States threatened to override the patent if Bayer did not drop its prices-which it then did.
See article: Patents, anthrax and antibiotics <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31721_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4a>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
The House of Representatives approved the president's anti-terrorism measures, which will now be taken up by the Senate.
Israel defiant
In a ferocious week-long assault that claimed more than 40 Palestinian lives, Israeli tanks and infantry reoccupied parts of six Palestinian-controlled cities. The declared aim was to arrest militants, including the group that killed an Israeli minister last week. America brusquely demanded that the tanks be withdrawn. The Israelis took their time.
See article: Pull back the tanks, says Bush to Sharon <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31729_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_52>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
After militants in central Nigeria killed 19 soldiers, armed men in civilian clothing attacked four villages, killing some 200 people. The army denied responsibility. Renegade soldiers are suspected.
A group of Commonwealth ministers visited Zimbabwe to investigate whether the government had acted on promises, made last month at a meeting in Nigeria, to end farm invasions and restore the rule of law. Few expected them to come up with a positive answer. Amnesty International reported that government-backed murders were increasing.
A South African mob attacked hundreds of Zimbabwean immigrants living in shacks near Johannesburg, accusing them of stealing jobs, and of various crimes. Hostility towards Zimbabweans has been rising across the country.
The fatal shore
At least 350 people, mostly Iraqi asylum-seekers, died when their overladen boat sank after leaving Indonesia bound for Australia. Australia said it had identified an Egyptian in Jakarta who had organised the voyage.
Thirteen people died in shooting incidents in Indian Kashmir, bringing to at least 150 the toll since militant protest flared after America started bombing Afghanistan. In a separate development, 20 Pakistanis training in Afghanistan for operations in Kashmir were reported killed by American bombs.
Innocent and guilty
Under heavy pressure from America and its own political wing, the Provisional (ie, mainstream) IRA began putting some of its weapons ""beyond use"". No details or numbers, but Northern Ireland's first minister, David Trimble, gave the news a hearty welcome.
See article: The IRA has put the peace process back on track <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31728_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_51>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
Britain's government eased the country's drug laws. Possessing small amounts of cannabis will no longer result in arrest and medicinal use is likely to be sanctioned.

Italy's final appeals court cleared the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, of involvement in bribing tax inspectors dealing with three companies in his Fininvest group. However, the court found several Fininvest managers guilty for their role in the bribery.
In Berlin, the Democratic Socialists-heirs of the communists who ran East Germany for the Russians-took 23% of the vote in the election for a new state administration.
See article: Ex-communists near power in Berlin <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31733_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4d>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
Macedonia's official police began patrolling areas formerly controlled by ethnic-Albanian guerrillas. Hardly had they left one village than its police station was blown up. Bad news for the peace deal, still not put into law by the parliament.
See article: A bombshell in Macedonia <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31732_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4c>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
In Galicia, Spain's north-western province, over 50% of the vote in a regional election went to the governing People's Party, ensuring a fourth consecutive term as premier for its leader, Manuel Fraga.
See article: Charlemagne: Manuel Fraga, premier of Galicia <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31731_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4b>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
Two trucks crashed head-on and caught fire in Switzerland's St Gotthard road tunnel. Ten people died and more than 80 are still missing.
Swap or default?
Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, made an unannounced visit to New York, apparently to try to persuade bankers of the virtues of a debt swap that rating agencies say may amount to a default. The government held back planned economic measures, after talks with provincial governors over budget cuts dragged on.
After 30 years of debate, Mexico's transport ministry at last decided on the site for a new international airport for Mexico city. It will be built on the dried-up bed of Lake Texcoco. The city's mayor said he would challenge the decision in the courts.
See article: Mexico's overdue new airport <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31734_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4e>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>
A leading human-rights lawyer was murdered in Mexico. Investigators suspected the army of being behind her death.

The following discusses the regulatory issues raised at our June 14 meeting
with Peoples.                                           1. Expanded
termination right for unacceptable ""Regulatory Approval"".  As discussed
prior to the meeting, language of Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2 and 15.1(f) was
changed to provide a termination right in the event that an unacceptable
regulatory order is issued after initial approval of the Agency Agreement,
but during its term. Peoples explained at the meeting their view that a
termination right should exist in the event of an adverse rate order (e.g.,
Illinois Commission order imputing what Peoples believes to be an
unreasonably high level of Hub revenue and, therefore, unaccpetably
lowering retail gas rates) or FERC determination that, based on Hub
operations, Peoples is in jeopardy of losing its status as a Hinshaw
pipeline. These were examples of the types of orders Peoples has in mind.
As proposed in our draft, either party would have a termination right in
the event that the Agency Agreement is not initially approved by the ICC on
acceptable terms. Under our approach, however, the parties would have to
live with ;later adverse regulatory orders unless an order had the effect
of revoking the Hub's operating authority. My view is that we could
reasonably agree to a termination right (similar to Sect. 11.1 (vi) and
(vii) of the LLC Agreement) which grants a termination right, ""in the event
that a Jugment determines that, as a result of Hub Transactions, Peoples is
subject to comprehensive rate regulation as a natural gas company or public
utility by the FERC; or loses its status as an exempt Hinshaw pipeline
under Section 1(c) of the Natural Gas Act."" I would suggest that we
otherwise stay with our original language re regulatory approvals. Once
Peoples obtains an order from the ICC which both parties accept, Peoples
should be willing to assume the risk (which,in my opinion is minimal) that
an adverse rate decision would cause it to wish to terminate the Agency
Agreement. (David suggested at the meeting that, as another option, we
could agree to a termination right due to an adverse regulatory order if
Peoples chooses to discontinue all Hub Transactions, but I am not sure that
we need to offer this at this stage.) The word ""required"" should be
restored to Definitions 1.1 and 1.11.              2. Extended Hub
Services. Peoples agreed at the meeting that there should be compensation
after termination of the Agreement for an extended Hub Service presented
during the Agreement's term. To make this clear,the words ""during the term
of this Agreement"" should be deleted from Sect. 7.1(ii). The deleted
wording of 7.2 should be restored, and to that Section we could add a
sentence: ""The right to compensation established under Section 7.2 (ii) for
an Extended Hub Service shall survive the termination of this Agreement.""
Also, in Section 15.4, I believe the reference to Sect. 3.3 should be to
7.2.                     3. ""Hub Services""-Sect. 1.17. Based on discussion
at the meeting, I understand that there is a need to address the ""two
county rule"" in the Agreement.  In connection with this, there was
discussion of the need to change the description of the Hub Services to
make clear that the services are incidental to the primary uses of the Hub
Facilities. As I understand it, the description of the services both for
the Agreement and the GTC may be changed to replace the existing references
to transportation services a reference to ""wheeling"" serivces. This should
be addressed when the revised terms of the GTC are available. I believe the
business people also are discussing a procedure for approval of
transactions to ensure compliance with the two county rule, and are
preparing a list of types of transactions which will be pre=approved.
4.
Adjustment of Administrative fee for refunds. Our position, as discussed at
the meeting, is that Sect. 7.3 which provides for retroactive adjustment of
the administrative fee in the event of a refund should be deleted. In
support, we point out that MEH relies on a specific fee value in seeking
out transactions and the fee shouldn't change after-the-fact as the result
of a refund. Peoples argues that a revenue-based fee should be adjusted if
there is a change in the realized level of revenue. This was left as an
open point. Peoples acknowledged at the meeting that the proposed fee
adjustment would occur only due to a rate refund. This means that the
administrative fee could be adjusted retroactively only if a transaction
occurs under a newly proposed rate which is part of the Operating
Statement, but subject to refund at a level higher than the previously
approved rate but lower than the maximum price under the new rate. The only
portion of the fee which is at risk is the portion produced by use of a
rate above the previously approved level. If, for example, a 10% increase
is proposed and made effective subject to refund. A risk arises only if the
negotiated price is at 90% of the maximum or above. If it is, the refund
risk to MEH is its percentage of the revenue produced by the rate above the
90%above. If the rate is 95% of the maximum, the amount at risk is 5% of
MEH's 20% portion of the revenue, or 1% of the fee. A refund at this level
would occur in the example only if FERC approves no rate increase and
requires a refund of all subject to refund revenue. If FERC approves all or
part of the increase, the refund risk is reduced. Therefore, the decision
should not greatly effect the economics of the deal. If we decide to allow
some adjustment of the fee for refunds, the language should make clear that
we are including only ""refunds related to a finding by FERC that a rate in
effect subject to refund is excessive and should be reduced.""
5. Also with respect to refunds (required for any cause), Peoples agreed at
the meeting to provide the necessary funds. We could adjust the language of
Sect. 3.3 to read: ""Peoples will pay to MEH all funds necessary to effect
such refunds on or before the earlier of : (i) the date prescribed by a Law
or Judgment for payment of such refunds; or (ii) ten (10) business days
after receiving written notice of the need for such payment."" (Note:
Because refunds are required by FERC Order, Peoples would always know when
the refund has to be paid.)
6. Admin. Fee. After the business discussion of intended coverage
of the monthly fixed fee, we should reconsider the deleted language in 18.3
regarding reimbursement of costs incurred by MEH on Peoples' behalf.
7. Nomination and
Scheduling on Pipelines. Sect. 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the language
we added which requires Peoples to make any necessary nominating or
scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt and delivery of gas
at its city gate for its own account in order to effectuate Hub
transactions. The language went on to also require Peoples to arrange for
delivery of gas at a secondary delivery point by Displacement Delivery. At
the meeting, Peoples took the position that it is already required to
handle nominations and scheduling on pipelines by terms of the GTC. Peoples
also indicated that, due to the nature of the Hub Facilities and
transactions, the Delivery Points must be on Peoples' system and that
Displacement Delivery to a point which Peoples can access under one of its
pipeline agreements is not feasible for a Hub Serivce. (Note: In the
Northern Illinois Gas Hub Agreement, the utility agreed to the provision we
proposed.) With regard to the second part of our proposed sentence re
delivery by displacement at a secondary point off-system, I agree that the
GTC seems to contemplate delivery on Peoples system for the various types
of transactions covered. Perhaps we can delete section ""(b)"" of our
proposed sentence. I would like to know whether the business people have
comments on this. With regard to the part (a) (the requirement that Peoples
make nominanting and scheduling changes needed to effectuate Hub
transactions), however, I do not find any language in the GTC which makes
clear that this is Peoples' responsibility. Also, at our preliminary
meeting, Laura indicated that this was an important provision to restore.
(I believe Laura mentioned only part a, but need to check this.)
Therefore, I believe we should propose, at least, to restore the sentence
through part a, subject to verification with Laura and Gregg.
8. Grounds to Refuse Trransaction. Also, in 2.5, Peoples
included as one of the grounds to refuse a Hub Service presented by MEH, a
conclusion by Peoples that ""Hub Capacity is deemed unavailable by Peoples
due to the service requirements of Peoples' utility customers."" We pointed
out at the meeting that the GTC (Sect. 8) specifies all circumstances when
a Hub Serivce can be refused and that this provision is not one of the
specified situations. Once a firm transaction is established under the GTC,
it has equal scheduling priority with other firm interstate and intrastate
firm transactions. Peopels agreed that this item (Item 3) can be deleted. I
believe Peoples wishes to revise (1) to read: "" permitted by the terms of
the GT&C, or required by any Law and Judment:.               9. Sect. 3.5.
Peoples proposes to delete our proposed Section 3.5 which requires Peoples
to use its best efforts to minimize imbalances experienced by Hub Shippers
through use of management services offered under pipeline tariffs. Such
services should be offered soon under Order 637 compliance filings. This
provision was inserted as part of a paragraph in Peoples' initial draft
which would have required MEH to compensate Peoples for imbalances
experienced on pieplines as a result of Hub Transactions. Peoples had taken
this provision from the NIGAS Hub agreement. In response, we had included
the wording of 3.5 to, at least, require best efforts to minimize
imbalances on the pipelines. Peoples now proposes to delete all of this on
the ground that imbalances on the pipelines are the responsibility of the
Hub Shippers, and not of Peoples or MEH. The GTC has provisions covering
the responsibility of shippers to address imbalances on the Hub Facilities,
and Peoples points to the Parking and Loaning  Service for Shippers to
address imbalances. In reviewin g this, I believe Peoples is right. Because
the language requiring MEH to address imbalnaces on the pieplines has been
deleted, I think we can delete the language of 3.5 requiring Peoples to use
best efforts to minimize those imbalances.
10. Sect. 2.2 Responsibility
for regulatory compliance. Peoples proposed changes to the language we
inserted in 2.2 in the second sentence from the end which indicated that
Peoples is responsible for compliance with the GTC. Peoples proposed that
each party be responsible. At the meeting, we explained that this language
was included to recognize FERC precedent requiring that, in circumstances
such as this, the agreement must identify the party responsible for
regulatory complaince and that party must be the certificate holder.
Peoples agreed at the meeting that our original language for this sentence
should be restored.      11. The Agreement (6.1) presently provides that
Peoples, in its sole discretion, may propose changes in the GTC. David
indicated at the meeting that, at a minimum, MEH should be advised of
changes in advance and provided with an opportunity for comments before
such changes are proposed. Peoples agreed to include such a provision.
Also, Peoples agreed that Section 5.1 should include a representation that
Peoples has provided MEH with a current copy of the presently effective
GT&C.
12.  Section 1.13. GTC.  Peoples agreed at the meeting that
the definition of GT&C  should be changed to end after the words ""from time
to time"". (This eliminates the refernce to  modification in Peoples' sole
discretion.)                                                           13.
Section 1.22 and 1.26. Peoples agreed that the definitions should refer
only to MEH and Peoples (and not to ""controlled"" persons)              14.
Section 1.15. Peoples agreed that the definition of Hub Capacity could be
changed to eliminate the reference to determination by Peoples in its sole
discretion. The determination should be ""in accordance with the GT&C.""
Peoples suggested that a standard of ""good faith""  or ""commercially
reasonable"" would be acceptable.
15. Section 5.1. Peoples
agreed at the meeting that Section 5.1 could be revised to eliminate the
refernce to Laws and Judgments with a materially adverse effect. Peoples
agrees that there should be a representation that the Agreement does n ot
violate ""any Judgment or Law applicable to it"",as originally proposed.
16. Section 2.9. The discussion at the meeting indicated
that Peoples may accept use of a standard of ""commercially reasonable"" with
regard to its judgment under 2.9(i) and MEH's obligation to perform in
accordance with the Operating Statement, Laws and Judgments in 2.9(ii). I
was surprised that Peoples suggested this re 2.9. As I understand it, the
concern is that MEH should not be liable for contract damages in the event
that it acts in a commercially reasonable manner, but cannot, for some
reason, comply with the GTC or a Law or Judgment. I wonder if we can
accomplish this result with language in a later section of the Agreement
regarding liability. My concern is that a provision indicating that MEH's
responsibility for compliance with regualtory requirements, Laws and
Judgments is limited to best efforts or items it knows about may raise a
red flag for the regulators. I would like to discuss whether there is
another way to deal with potential liability without changing 2.9(ii) to
refer to ""best"" or ""commercially reasonable"" efforts. Let's discuss
tomorrow.                                17. Section 10.1. Filing for
Governmental Approval. At the meeting, Peoples indicated that, although it
believes it should have sole control over regulatory filings, Peoples will
agree to include a provision indicating that:""Prior to the filing of
applications, pleadings or testimony related to approval for operation of
the Hub, Peoples will provide copies of such materials to MEH, and consider
comments provided by MEH."" We should discuss with the business peoples
whether this is sufficient, and how specific this provision should be. The
language here would be comparable to that inserted in 6.1 regarding the
right to review and comment on changes to the GTC.
18. Dissolution of
MEH. Peoples agreed that a portion of our proposed 15.1(f), up to the word
""terminated"" on line 2 should be restored. Peoples only concern in
proposing deletion was that the LLC Agreement might be requested by the ICC
Staff due to the reference. As revised, the reference is removed.
19. Confidentiality. Peoples agreed to re-think the provisions of 17.1 re
confidentiality of the compensation provions of Articles 3 and 7. This was
not confidential in the NIGAS approval proceeding. Because the ICC Staff
will be aware of the provisions, I do not know why Peoples proposes to
require the procedures needed to maintain confidentiality of these
provisions in the approval proceeding.
20. Section 18.4. Peoples agreed to mutual review and agreement re
forward-looking statements re the Hub.                            21.
Section 2.4. At the meeting, Peoples agreed that the third sentence is
confusing and should be revised. I would suggest: "" Peoples will inform MEH
promptly after it learns of information indicating that a revision to
information regarding Hub Capacity should be made or proposed in accordance
with this Section.""
Tomorrow, I will re-review my notes to
make sure that I have covered the regulatory areas. I have notes on other
sections also if you have any need for them. I'll give you a call tomorrow
after I return from a morning hearing around 11:00am."

As we discussed, I am not confident that the Automated Securities Clearance NDA sufficiently covers us in this new matter.  I have called Henry Bonner at SunGard to verify the legal structure to see if we can or cannot use it; however, he has yet to return my call.
I have prepared the attached based upon a belief that we should have in place an NDA specifically with SunGard Trading & Risk Systems.  Because we also want to move this matter forward, I have attached to the agreement a ""Schedule A"" in which I have outlined the work that SunGard will be performing for us - at least at the onset.  If we go beyond the first five days of this work, we should definitely have a formal consulting agreement signed to ensure we have a clear path forward on the work to be done and deliverables to be provided.
In the meantime, please take a look at the attached and let me know if this works.
Thanks.

Dear Rick,
You might remember me; we met in September when you visited Metgas in Mumbai 
with the LNG team. At the time I presented a piece on the MetGas equity sale 
and opportunities of cooperation with the Indian Oil Company.
Following Sanjay's new role in the organisation, he has now charged me with 
developing the EBS business in the Middle East. In this regard I had a 
telecon with Mac McClelland yesterday, the details of which are copied in the 
mail below. 
I would like to visit Dubai possibly next week to see the Dubai Internet 
City, meet with senior officials at the Internet and Media cities to identify 
what opportunities there could be for EBS.
We look forward to closely cooperating with you and your team in Dubai.
With best regards,   Anil

Subject: Conference call regarding Middle East EBS support
Mac,
You would be aware that Sanjay Bhatnagar has been given the responsibility of 
managing EBS business in the Middle East and Asia and our team reports 
directly to him. We are currently wanting to develop an EBS strategy for the 
Middle East. For this objective Amr Ibrahim (Director, Regulatory) and myself 
would like to plan a visit to Dubai in the near future (possibly early next 
week). We would like to have a half hour conference call with you today to 
discuss this visit. Based on your exposure and presence in Dubai, we would 
like to seek advise from you on the below, which would be the objective of 
our trip;
Dubai Internet City. We are well aware of this tremendous infrastructure that 
has been developed in Dubai. Our information is based on what was available 
on the web. We would like to see this facility, meet with the relevant people 
in the Communications group and establish what business opportunities could 
be available for EBS. From our understanding, the DIC infrastructure has 
being developed by Siemens, Sun and Cisco. Fibre connectivity is provided by 
a local telecom party. 
Business potential. We would be developing a business plan for the Middle 
East region and would like to identify what support we could get from Enron's 
immendate presence in the region, in the way of direction.
Immediate business opportunity. What are the low hanging fruit for EBS in the 
Middle East region and what are the first areas we should focus on that would 
give us success, to quickly neutralize cost.
How do we get multiple entry visas for Dubai. Is it possible to get a one (or 
three) month visa. Can we them for coming Sunday or would it be a rush? We 
have Canadian and Danish passports.
I will call you at 12 noon (Dubai time) this morning. 
With best regards,   Anil"

"Subject: Garcia Response of the Proposed Gallup C/S
Body: With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia  concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline  Company offers the following response:  Pipeline Integrity.
With the construction of the evaporation ponds over  Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored  the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.
This includes a more frequent  inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking  potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the  potential of pipeline corrosion.
As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has  cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline  coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the  evaporation ponds.
The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern  are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system  at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also  allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art  monitoring and detection.
Noise Issue.
In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern  conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures  which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso  Station.
Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post  noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above  those levels mandated by FERC.
In the event of operational noise levels  exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to  performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post  noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.
Decrepancy of trailer park residents.
In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was  stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the  adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study,  but ""more like 35 trailers"".
The number of mobile home residences currrently  in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.
Transwestern's trailer park  residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job  market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job  economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature  of the residences.
It should also be noted that during the time that the  trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the  operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the  operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments  and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the  trailer park residents.
It was actually noted that many of the spaces  normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.
This unsanitary  condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.
The  NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.

2002 Real-Time Market.
In addition, the NYISO is reserving hour beginning 23:00 in the January 17,
2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.
Prices in the January 18, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.
Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

I would of course keep in confidential.  I am actually so surprised to hear
it.  Can you give me any better of an explanation??  Does she just annoy
you?  Does she bring up subjects you don't like?  Do you care if she's
around if it's a big group of people (like the bluegrass festival)?  Does
she share your secrets?  I only want to know because it would set up some
ground rules.  I mean if she comes to the bluegrass festival, does that mean
you wouldn't??  You mean more to me than almost anyone so I would never want
to alienate you or make you uncomfortable.  Just a little better
understanding would help.
Yes, you mentioned DB, but we were in the midst of trying to get the stupid
strat sourcing group to go forward with the phase one (which we still want
to happen and its moving very slowly and you might be able to help if you
talk to the stupid guy and tell him you know about us and think we are
awesome).  But, Dealbench is more of a bus dev thing (which means ME of
course) and I wasn't to start working on this as some things have hit our
radar screen and they look like they are probably ready to talk to us.  I
just want to only talk to the right people and hopefully with a small
endorsement from you to jump start the whole thing.  What do you think of
that?

Let's talk more to discuss the latest developments.  Glad to hear that it's

You MUST keep this strictly confidential----I've know Colleen for years.
She's a sweet dear friend of mine.  But she's driving me fucking crazy.  I
am very happy that you two are buddies and having fun together and that
she's being such a big help with your wedding.  But it's going to be best
for you and me and Colleen and Scott and Tony Blair and Oprah Winfrey and
Sammy Soza, and everyone else, if my contact with the wonderful Ms Silva is

Just want and need you to know.  And please keep it very confidential.

OK, it looks like DealBench has hit our radar screen hard here.  Can you
help me get a meeting set up with the right people??
Look like the strat sourcing group in Houston is requesting a ""sand box"" to
play in to test out our product.  Did you ever get a chance to put in a
good
word there?
David Hoffman wrote me and said he really enjoyed spending time with you
and
said you were such a smart and thoughtful guy.  Thought you might like the
compliment.  I am going to check out his house as a wedding site on
Thursday
with Colleen and then go have dinner with Lisanne.  Any chance you guys
want
to come along?
Write back soon...

I'll leave DealBench in your hands, but please keep me advised as it

----------------------------------
David H,
Here's a wrapup of my meeting with DealBench two weeks ago.  I left a
voicemail for Cameron yesterday asking her how to proceed with them, as
this
would become a BizDev deal with a perceived competitor.
On another note, the 2 EES Proc Mgrs that Jim F and I met with a couple of
weeks ago, mentioned that they have an initiative on the table to run a
reverse auction by July 15, and that they are considering BayBuilder.  They
said they don't care about the DealBench platform, it doesn't meet their
needs and DealBench isn't giving any better deal to Enron's business units
than they would to anyone else off the street.
Ian and I are trying to schedule a meeting next Tuesday with Proc Mgrs from
several business units along with John Gillespie from GSS in order to demo
Perfect Insight and discuss our Early Adopter Program.

Subject:        EnronOnline / DealBench
Met for 45 min w Suresh Raghavan to discuss DealBench (Enron's proprietary
auction platform) and the potential for Perfect to provide complementary
solutions to their customers through EnronOnline and beyond.  We agreed
that
the purpose of our discussions would not be to have him sponsor us to the
Global Strategic Sourcing unit, but only to consider Perfect as a bus dev
deal.  We would need to price ourselves as an ASP for them, but with the
liquidity they have (supposedly like $1B per day traded through
EnronOnline), this should be a no-brainer.
Suresh is the Principal of DealBench, as well as a Director of Enron Net
Works.  DealBench is one of many business units under the Enron Wholesale
Services / Enron Net Works group, including EnronOnline, ClickPaper,
MetalMarkets, and other wholesale marketplace services.  DealBench has 3
primary offerings:
* Auctioning/RFQ management
* Deal Rooms with complex negotiations tools
* Data Rooms  for sharing of secure documents such as CADs, blue prints,
etc
for M&A due diligence.
We discussed the basic functionality and sophisticated math behind Perfect,
and he felt that it was worth considering further as a complementary
service
offering for the DealBench platform.  He would like to arrange a demo for
him and some of his managers for the end of June or early July."

PICK NEWS - CALLS (continued)
*******************************************************
MSFT $171.56 +9.69 (+15.31)  Wow!!  It doesn't
get much better than this.  MSFT announced their 2:1 stock
split (effective 3/26) prior to yesterday's market open and
immediately gapped-up at the opening.  Those of you still
in the play going into last weekend were richly rewarded
Monday Morning.  Everyone wants to own MSFT and nobody
wants to sell.  This sentiment on 2 times normal volume
produced a textbook run-up -- as if ""astrodollar"" earnings
aren't enough.  Price targets are now at $200.  Of note,
MSFT announced they would phase in Alta-Vista, Compaq's to-
be-spun-off-in-an-IPO search engine, and ease out Inktomi.
Use stops to protect your profits.  With so much money on
the table, we suggest waiting for a pullback before
starting a new play.  As always, confirm market direction
first.
DH $60.88 +0.63 (+0.94)  As we said Sunday,
not a fast mover, but a steady gainer. 1189 institutions
own 89.5% of the 395 million shares in float leaving about
40 million shares in daily float to trade.  On average
volume of 2 million shares, DH traded within $1.50 range
both days this week, sheltering investors from a tumultuous
market. Look for the rise to continue, market permitting.
Slow news week so far; nothing to move the price.  Just
hare-speed momentum.  Dayton Hudson is the parent company
of Target Stores
VIA.B $81.88 -1.13 (-0.68)  Profit taking has caused a slight
dip in Viacom.  But, it has been so small that it actually can
be interpreted as a positive sign for the stock.  VIA.B seems
to undergo an occasional consolidation.  Then it goes on its
merry way.  As always, wait for the signal to turn green
before hitting the gas.  Blockbuster Inc., a subsidiary of
Viacom, teamed up with Warner Home Video in a revenue sharing
agreement.   As a result, Blockbuster will be able to rent
more new releases and other videos to its customers.  Chyron
Corporation will deliver Liberty NT software to an affiliate
of Paramount which is partially owned by Viacom.  The new
system will allow access to paint and animation capabilities
on the Windows NT platform.
WAG $59.50 +1.13 (+1.06)  On Tuesday, Walgreen's flexed its
muscles in a display strength and closed at it's high for the
day.  Its only resistance is at it's all time high set back in
December at $60.44.  With its 2:1 stock split scheduled for
Feb. 12th, it appears WAG is getting in shape to make a nice
run.
LXK $108.00 +3.88 (+8.75) Well, we have good news and bad news
on LXK this week.  Let's start with the bad news.  LXK did
not announce a stock split with earnings.  Their annual
shareholder meeting isn't until April, so a stock split
announcement would have to come on an arbitrary day.  We
noticed that companies, like Microsoft, have held off a few
days before announcing their splits.  This might be a ploy
to take the price high on the earnings announcement and then
take it higher with the split announcement.  The good news
is that LXK announced earnings of $1.16 a share.  This was
$.05 above consensus estimates.  The company also stated
there is a high demand for printer components.  LXK is in
blue-sky territory as it has broken through any prior
resistance.
VOD $193.50 +2.88 (+5.12) VOD has come back to life the last
two trading days with gains of $2.88 and $2.24.  There isn't
any recent news on VOD, but there is one very positive
technical aspect.  The last three trading days have seen
VOD close right at the high of the day.  This shows a very
bullish tendency as the bulls seem to be winning the battle
on a daily basis.
XIRC $42.31 +.38 (+.31) XIRC seems to have entered a
consolidation phase.  The volatility was pretty high before
earnings, but the daily range has decreased substantially
the last three trading days.  We still feel this stock is a
good purchase.  Watch for a strong up-move on good volume.
XIRC's 52-week high is at $44.50.  A move through this level
should provide a nice rally.  XIRC did announce today that
they will provide wireless data support for Siemans handsets.
SNC $39.50 +.56 (+1.75) SNC continued to rise today, albeit
at a smaller pace.  No news on SNC, but earnings are around
the 10th of February and SNC has historically had nice
earnings surprises.  There isn't much of a chance of an
upgrade for this stock, being that the five analysts that
follow it all rank it a strong buy.  We guess there could be
a new analyst recommendation.  We could see a continued run
into earnings.  SNC's 52-week high is $54.18.
XLNX $82.56 +5.44 (+4.37) XLNX did the job on Tuesday with
over a 6% gain.  XLNX has done what a lot of stocks do after
announcing great earnings and a stock split and that is to
consolidate briefly and then continue up.  XLNX dropped on
Monday, but came back with a vengeance on Tuesday. XLNX's
resistance is at its 52-week high of $87.63.  Pullbacks
would be good buying opportunities.
MU $71.88 +2.88 (+1.38) Micron showed some weakness on Monday
in a mixed semi-conductor market. It was off $1.50 even as a
few of the other chip stocks moved up in sympathy with LSI
Logic.  LSI had received an upgrade from hold to strong buy.
Today, however, MU was up $2.88 in a generally strong semi-
conductor sector. Any upgrades and strong earnings from other
stocks in the sector, as well as from the hardware stocks,
should help MU.  Like Dell, it reports later in the earnings
season, so an earnings run would start a little later.
Earnings in February.
NOKA $145.38 +1.38 (+.82) After hitting $155.38 on Wednesday,
Jan. 20th, Nokia has gapped down at the open each of the last
four trading days. It has also CLOSED well above its opening
price the last few days, and today it managed to close $1.38
above yesterday's close. This company is located in Finland
and trades in Europe while we sleep. The Europeans seem to be
sending the stock lower while the Americans are sending it
back up each day on the NYSE. Only two days left for an
earnings run--earnings are due out before the bell on Friday.
We believe that there is a good possibility of a split
announcement with earnings. If you don't want to risk holding
over earnings, be sure to sell your options before the close
on Thursday.  You can pick them up again if a split is announced.
That is the conservative way to make this play. If you hold over,
you risk a loss of capital, should Nokia disappoint. For those
of you with high risk tolerance, please note that Nokia jumped
$9 the day it announced it's last split.  It then ran up another
$34 before the split.

ANF - Abercrombie & Fitch $73.94 +2.06 (+4.19 for the week)
Abercrombie & Fitch sells men's and women's casual clothes
and accessories in over 170 stores across America.  Their
comfortable styles of jeans and crews are especially popular
with teens and college students.  Check out this Volkswagen
hip-hop retailer the next time you are strolling through
the mall.
Abercrombie has established a nice upward trend since its
lows in October.  It has been virtually unstoppable with
only two minor bouts of profit taking along the way.  In
intraday trading on Tuesday, ANF set another all-time high
at the $75 level.  Look for ANF to continue its steady trend
into blue skies.  There hasn't been a lot of news as of late
for Abercrombie.  But, back on Jan 8th, an article in Reuters
commented that since American Eagle Outfitters had posted
nice sales figures, it was safe to assume that Abercrombie
could do the same.

SEPR - Sepracor Inc. $104.25 +2.50 (+4.75 for the week)
Sepracor Inc. is a company that researches, develops, and
sells chemicals that are new, patented forms of existing
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical compounds.  These
products are made to reduce the side effects and increase
the safety of drugs already on the market today.  They are
used to treat several conditions that include asthma,
allergies, pain, and insomnia.  As an example, SEPR
developed Allegra as an alternative to Seldane which lost
FDA approval in 1997.
Sepracor Inc. has a stellar graph.  The company has been on
an uptrend since it was at the $40 level back in June and
in intraday trading Tuesday, SEPR set another all time high
at $105.50.  Last Friday, Jan. 22nd, BancBoston Robertson
Stephens initiated coverage of this steady stock with a
""long-term attractive rating.""  They projected a 12-month
price target of $112.  They seem to favor this company which
has two approved drugs and six drugs in late phase clinical
development.  Look for SEPR to continue its upward trek if
current market conditions remain steady.

WMT - Wal-Mart $83.56 +1.56 (+1.56)
The king of retailers is back! Wal-Mart is the leading
discount retailer in the world, with a presence in all 50
states, as well as Canada, Mexico, Asia, Latin America, and
Europe. In addition to discount department stores, it
operates the #2 grocery chain, behind Kroger's, and Sam's
clubs, which is the #2 warehouse chain. This retail giant's
market capitalization is $182.3 billion.
We covered Wal-Mart recently, but dropped it when the stock
began pulling back. It appears to be moving out of a
consolidation phase and has been trending up for a week, with
only one slightly down day in that period. Wal-Mart had a
strong holiday season. It continues to grow at home and also
abroad, partly through acquisitions. It is now growing its
profits faster than its sales once again.
As an option play, WMT is a steady mover. While it lacks the
fast moves of the technology and Internet stocks, it is a
safer play, and has the added advantage of being a split
candidate. The stock last split in February 1993. Its last
three splits occurred when WMT traded in the mid-60s.
Earnings are due out in February.

COMBINATION PLAYS   - Split-O-Rama
*****************************************************
Monday, January 25
U.S. blue-chip stocks ended higher Monday after a volatile day of
trading amid a slew of mixed earnings results from multi-national
companies. The DJIA closed unofficially up 82 points at 9203.32.
The Dow shed 57 points early in the day but recovered as several
big-name companies including AT&T and 3M reported earnings. The
high-flying Nasdaq Index gained 30 points to 2369.11 primarily on
the shoulders of Microsoft shares after the company declared a 2:1
stock split. A report that analysts expect IBM to announce a stock
split after its board meets Tuesday helped Big-Blue reverse a $6
loss from early in the day and close slightly higher at $180.93.
Despite big gains in the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite, breadth on
both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq was negative as
decliners outpaced advancers on both exchanges.
Most of the Sunday plays were available near the recommended entry
points. MRK opened the day around $137 and traded slightly higher
just before 10 AM. The first prices listed for the FEB160C/155C
bear-call spread were around $0.75 credit. EMC was also slow to
start trading and opened slightly higher near $100. Our put-credit
spread; FEB75P/80P did not have any volume but the bid/ask quotes
were within $0.12 of our target entry of $0.50. SKYT was a pair of
plays; the calendar spread, JUN25C/FEB25C was easily opened for
$2.38 debit. The best we saw on the ITM debit spread, FEB22C/25C
was $2.00 (higher than our target) and that was a little slim on
the ROI potential so we decided to pass. PLCM fell hard in a post
earnings dip but that just brought the sold position nearer to ATM
and a higher time component. We decided to take advantage of the
lower entry price; $0.87 for the MAR25C/FEB25C time spread, and
hope the stock finishes around $25 in four weeks. NRC was very
interesting as the option quotes opened near the previous closing
prices but soon moved apart in the spread (MAR50C/FEB50C) even
though the stock price remained quiet and the volume was fairly
docile. Our initial price was $1.12. CNTO, the butterfly spread,
moved lower most of the day reducing our initial entry to $0.87
for the FEB35C/40C/45C position. Remember, there is a method of
legging out of a butterfly spread that is acceptable. If the
stock price moves significantly, early in the life of the
spread, the BULL spread portion or the BEAR spread portion can
be closed-out near their maximum profit potentials. The spreader
may want to take advantage of this situation in order to profit
more if the stock reverses direction and comes back into the
profit range. By increasing his risk slightly, he may be able to
improve his position significantly by converting the butterfly
spread to a vertical spread. Although the chances of such a trend
reversal cannot be considered great, it does not cost the trader
much to restructure himself into a position with a much broader
maximum profit. That's our plan, we'll see what happens...
In other portfolio activities; PCS just keeps climbing like there
is no gravity and we just wonder where it will end. If any of you
are exercised early on the short side of the spread, let us know.
SRCM is a source of pain as the stock price has fallen sharply
without any change in the buying pressure. We decided to pull the
plug and prevent any losses. The JAN17P was closed at $1.25 and
we would expect to sell the JAN15P at a minimum of $0.50 for a
break-even exit. The initial target will be $1.00 until the stock
reverses (upward) again.
Tuesday, January 26
On Tuesday, U.S. stocks rallied in afternoon trading to close near
session highs. Solid earnings reports, stock splits, and big tech
deals all boosted the market. The DJIA closed unofficially up 115
points at 9318.40. The Nasdaq index of technology issues finished
up almost 65 points at 2433.46, surpassing a record high close of
2415.49 set on January 20th. Big gains in shares of IBM, Xerox,
Microsoft and Yahoo accounted for much of the positive movement.
On Tuesday, our big movers were AOL, CPQ, LVLT and SUNW. AOL was
the only issue we acted on, closing half of our debit position at
$2.25 for a $0.75 profit. On the LVLT debit spread, we expect to
close at about a $6.50 credit for a $2.00 profit. SRCM continued
downward but did not reach our target exit for the FEB15P. Watch
for signs of a turn-around as the buying pressure is still very
healthy on this stock. PCS just keeps climbing, about 6 days in a
row. MRK had a surprise rebound today, climbing $6 on a positive
earnings announcement. More to discuss on Thursday...

    - NEW PLAYS -
Today we will focus on some of the common stocks in the blue-chip
technology group. We rarely play these issues because the main
section of the newsletter covers these stocks in-depth and we like
to bring you a wide array of candidates. These companies are in
the news everyday and the earnings/split-mania is just too much to
pass up...Good Luck!
******************************************************************
MSFT - Microsoft  $171.56     *** Disparity? ***
Microsoft Corp. develops, manufactures, licenses and supports a
range of software products, including scalable operating systems,
server applications, business and productivity applications,
software development tools and Internet software and technologies.
Microsoft rules! With a market value that far outstrips its sales,
Microsoft is the world's #1 software company. Softwares include
Windows, Excel, MS Word, PowerPoint, and Encarta. The Microsoft
Network provides online content, and its Internet Explorer is
still battling Netscape Navigator for market share. With NBC, the
company operates cable news channel MSNBC. They also provide email
with ""Hotmail"" and many other services.
Everybody is making deals with MSFT. To make AltaVista a premier
destination site on the Web, Compaq announced a partnership with
Microsoft in which AltaVista will offer a e-mail service based on
Microsoft's Hotmail service. In addition, AltaVista and Microsoft
agreed to make AltaVista's Web search the primary search vehicle
for the Microsoft Network Internet site.
The big news (of course) was the blow-out earnings and the 2:1
stock-split. On Monday, Microsoft said its stock split would
increase its shares outstanding to 5 billion and make its stock
more affordable. The split will take effect on 3/12/98 if it is
approved by shareholders.
We expect MSFT will consolidate somewhat after the news wears off
but there is no doubt it will return to the headlines shortly
thereafter. Sell the time premium now before it evaporates in
this small disparity play.
PLAY (conservative):
BUY  PUT MAR-155 OI=686  A=$4.00
SELL PUT MAR-160 OI=3842 B=$5.38
NET CREDIT TARGET=$1.50 ROI=42% (2 months)
Chart = http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT&d=3m
******************************************************************
DELL - Dell Computer  $88.50     *** Almost Free Money ***
Dell Computer is one of the world's top PC makers and the world's
#1 direct-sale computer vendor. The company sells hardware and
markets third-party software and peripherals. Products include
notebooks, PCs, and network servers. Dell also markets a variety
of peripherals and software for other manufacturers. More than 90%
of its systems are sold to businesses and government entities. The
company continues to expand services such as its Web site, which
is expected to process half of it's transactions by the year 2000.
Dell recently announced that they have secured a share of the #1
position in the worldwide personal workstation market. They also
continue as the number one vendor for customer satisfaction and
their scores are significantly higher than most competitors in
price/performance, overall reliability, repair and delivery time.
Dell will post earnings sometime in mid-February and we expect
the stock to make the traditional run to the actual announcement.
In addition to buying calls, you might elect to make this play
with current portfolio collateral. This is a low return spread
based on another small disparity but the worst that could happen
is you choose to own DELL at $69.19.
PLAY (very conservative):
BUY  PUT MAR-65 DLQ-OM OI=766  A=$1.19
SELL PUT MAR-70 DLQ-ON OI=2341 B=$1.81
NET CREDIT TARGET=$0.81 ROI=19%

******************************************************************
XRX - Xerox Corp.  $116.31     *** Split Play ***
Xerox engages in worldwide development, marketing, manufacturing,
financing and servicing of document processing products.
This week, Xerox delivered another record quarter, reflecting
strong double-digit earnings growth consistent with company
objectives, even though pre-currency revenue growth was clearly
affected by some weaker economies. Their fourth quarter diluted
earnings per share increased 16% to $1.69 and income increased
17% to $615 million, primarily as a result of outstanding growth
in digital product revenues, improved operating margins and
ongoing benefits from the worldwide restructuring program. Xerox
also announced an 11% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on
the company's common stock and a two-for-one stock split.
The stock split will be effective for shareholders of record on
2/4/99 and distributed on 2/23/98. The quarterly dividend will
increase 11% to 20 cents on a post-split basis, payable on 4/1/98
to shareholders of record on March 5. Today's gap-up and the
split date make perfect timing for a one month spread. Plan to
close the play near the February strike date on the pre-split run.
BUY  CALL MAR-120 XRX-CD OI=40   A=$7.12
SELL CALL FEB-120 XRX-BD OI=1487 B=$3.75
NET DEBIT TARGET=$3.12 TARGET ROI=25%
Chart = http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=XRX&d=3m
******************************************************************
IBM - Intl. Business Machines  $185.50     *** Split Play ***
International Business Machines is the world's top provider of
computer hardware and it is #2 in software. The company makes a
broad range of computers, including PCs, mainframes, and network
servers. The company also makes software and peripherals, and has
an ever-expanding service arm. IBM owns software pioneer Lotus
Development, maker of the Lotus Notes messaging system. Almost 60%
of the company's sales are to foreign customers and IBM continues
to revamp its image, with a focus on Internet business.
As expected, IBM declared a two-for-one stock split, just one day
after software rival Microsoft did the same. IBM posted fourth
quarter earnings last week that exceeded street expectations but
saw its shares fall after failing to announce a split. Today, the
stock rebounded on the renewed interest. The new shares should be
distributed on or about May 26 to shareholders of record on May 10.
The IBM board also set a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per
share, payable March 10 to stockholders of record on Feb. 10.
Although the current technical (and earnings) outlook is somewhat
lackluster, we believe Big-Blue will rise to the occasion and
easily hold $185 on the strike date in March.

Attached please find the Activity Survey for the month of May, 2000.
I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the ""bar is being raised"" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.
The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial 
teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the 
requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity 
driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of 
day Friday, June 2.
Please note the following updates:
For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the 
survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please 
provide statistics accordingly
If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email 
Jennifer Reside
If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction, 
please call or email Jennifer Reside
If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the 
surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will 
eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like 
us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next 
month, please let Jennifer know.
Please contact Jennifer Reside x3-5971 with questions (Shari is on vacation 
this week), or if you are unable to complete the survey within the allotted 
time.

Art Daboub

daboub1@airmail.net
To Mr. Ken Lay,
I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.
Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.
The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. The judge might go easier on you.
Sincerely,
Art Daboub"

***Viking Days 2000 - Thanks for Coming Home!:
October 6-8 was quite the weekend for Augustana.  It began with the
inauguration of Dr. Bruce Halverson '66 as Augustana's 22nd
President.  Cold weather didn't keep alumni away from the parade. And the
football game against NDSU was a good fight.  We inducted the Class of
1950 into the Honor Guard at the Heritage Honor Luncheon and honored
outstanding individuals at the Athletic Hall of Fame Banquet on Friday
night and at the Alumni Banquet on Saturday night.  Viking Varieties was a
hit in the Sioux Falls Arena and the crowd was great at the Afterglow,
complete with music by President Halverson and the Fabulous Jadesmen and
Doc Krueger and the Alumni Brass Choir.  Click on
http://www.augie.edu/alumni/homecoming.html for pictures from the
weekend.  Class pictures can be found at the ""Reunions Site"" under each
class year. Plan now to attend Viking Days 2001, October 5-7.  The Classes
of 1936, 1941, 1946, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1991,
and 1996 will celebrate reunions.

Paul Krueger, who has been Associate Director of Alumni Relations the

I believe that you agreed at our last meeting that it might be well for you 
and me -- and Ken if available -- to discuss plans for this group in 2001. My 
feeling is that we should review its composition after the election -- we may 
lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look 
at who is contributing and who isn't etc.
My agenda would be:
1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two 
purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important 
fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it 
is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).
2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss 
in 2001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time? 
3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001, given 
whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.
4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting 
outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we 
like to attract?
I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you 
thinking.
Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn 
Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more convenient."

Greg will be coming to visit Monday, October 22nd, and in addition to the day-to-day activity we do with MOPS, he is interested in talking about the services we can provide during the interim transition period.  I will be in Lubbock that day, so could one of you be the contact for Greg to call when he gets here?  
 
Donna, Sarabeth has provided the base services agreement to us, so we do have a document to start with, but we still need to find out from Williams what specifically they want us to do. We also need to be aware of the issues Rita has brought up regarding system enhancements that would be necessary to capture bifurcated rates, change the invoice template, provide ad hoc reports to Williams, etc. Sarabeth was deliberate in pointing out that the services agreement did not contemplate assuming liabilities greater than the value of the contract.  In the event Williams requires higher levels of liability, (more than $10,000/mo) we can purchase insurance, and the cost of the premium would be added to our fees.
 
I'll let you know times when I learn of Greg's travel arrangements.
 
Thanks, Bob

        While there is seasonal correlations in power, especially for Np-15 
and SP-15 (same region), the term structure of correlations can be input.  
However, the same correlation structure with similar periodicity may not hold 
between Np-15 and, say, R1B (Neepool), though one would imagine that  
relationship would still be seasonal (summer/winter), with greater noise.  
Even if the correlational term structure is to be done for Power, different 
rules would have to be inputted for different regions.

Subject: Re: implementing term-structure of correlations for power  
Vlady & Naveen,
I am sending you the factor loadings for power calculated based on the prices 
from 25-jun-00 to 25-sep-00. They look rather messy. 
Thus joint estimation of factors for a few regions does not look realistic.
Instead we might implement the term structure of correlations. 
Instead of heaving 1 correlation matrix based on prompt month prices and 
applying this matrix to all maturities,
we can have a number correlation matrices each corresponding to a particular 
prompt month.
I attached the term structure of correlations between R10 and R11 calculated 
using 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 months
of historical forward prices prior to 30-sep-00 with and without decay factor.
You can see that:
1)  the results are close for 5, 4, and 3 months of history;
2) correlations are periodic with a period of 1 year (this means we can use 
12 correlation matrices calculated from 
first 12 forward contracts and apply these matrices to other forward months);
3) Using decay factor makes the curves a little smoother.
Implementation of multiple correlation matrices will not affect the speed of 
calculations in VAR model significantly.
Please, give me your response,
Thanks,
Tanya.

Subject: Cline/Panther Principal Payment
This memo is being sent to inform you that the September 30 Panther principal 
payment was made today and to clarify the confusion around the delay for the 
payment. Panther is one of the operating subsidiaries in our DPR Holding 
Company relationship with Chris Cline.
As many of you are aware, we are in the process of restructuring the Panther 
loan. Panther has violated certain financial covenants as a result of the 
lack of coal production when the mine was temporarily idled. These covenant 
violations put the loan in default and put us in a position to restructure 
certain aspects of the relationship. (All principal and interest payments 
have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown).
Part of the restructuring may involve deferring certain principal payments 
until 6/30/00 when Panther is expected to resume coal production. Since we 
are in the process of negotiating certain changes and since DPR Holding 
Company was sitting on $2.0 mm to be used for the payment and/or dividend 
distributions, they asked if they could wait until the distribution payment 
date in November before making the principal payment. This would give us a 
few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable 
them to defer the payment until June. This would also allow DPR to make a 
larger dividend distribution to both us and Cline. 
I told them that this was okay but that it did not constitute a waiver or 
decision to defer the payment. Unfortunately, this was not communicated well 
internally. I felt that this was an acceptable action because the company has 
the money and we are in the process of restructuring the repayment schedule. 
I also viewed it as a minor accomodation to Cline who has personally spent 
over $5 million on equipment for the project since January and has not 
charged the joint venture. 
However, to avoid hurting the relationship or DPR's reputation internally, 
Cline made the payment today."

Subject: California Schedules
Body: 
Group,
When doing an import or an export from California there are a few important 
guidelines to remember.
IMPORT-This must be FIRM.  A firm import is required so that we provide the 
spinning reserves to California (we do this by buying firm energy for the 
import).  If the import is non-firm, California will charge us their price 
for spinning reserve margins.  This could easily be $400 per mw come this 
summer.
EXPORT-This must be NON-FIRM.  A non-firm export allows us to provide 
spinning reserves to our bilat trading partners (or to simply sell the energy 
without spinning reserves as ""non-firm""), and NOT have to pay the California 
price for spinning reserve margins.  Conversely if we do a firm export, we 
would have to pay for California to supply spinning reserves.  And because 
California will sometime use actual purchased energy for spinning reserves, 
this could easily be $400 per mw this summer.
California has also proposed cutting firm exports this summer, so a ""firm"" 
export does not imply that the energy would actually be exported anymore than 
nonfirm.
IF you have other questions.  Please let me know.
Thanks,
Bill"

Subject: Iowa de reg update
Body: 
Unless the Easter weekend brings about the resurrection of this bill, de reg 
is dead in Iowa for the 2000 session.  The House and Senate leadership 
announced today that they would not bring the bill up for a vote this year.  
The session is going to recess tonight for the holiday, they will reconvene 
on Monday, and most likely now adjourn on Wednesday.  
I am certainly disappointed that our efforts were not successful--especially 
in light of our being part of a very diverse coalition in support of the bill 
that included the coops, munis, Mid American, Alliant, industrial customers, 
school boards, low income providers,retailers, grocers, etc.

Subject: Iowa de reg update
A wild week in Iowa.  By the end of the day Tuesday, it became clear to all 
parties that the bill would not be called for a vote.  The customers were 
unwilling to give anymore on the enviroment issues and the democrats would 
similarly not back off their positions.  Mid American then switched gears to 
pull out all the stops on getting labor support in order to trump the enviro 
supporters.  Mid American put forward a proposal to the unions/legislators 
that they would commit to build 2 power plants in the state of Iowa (as 
opposed to developing in Illinois) over the next 5 years that would employ 
union labor. Mid American also had it's top management making many visits 
this week---Greg Abel and I believe also David Sokol.  (No Warren Buffet 
sightings yet!!!!)This offer created a flurry of activity on both sides, but 
at the end of the day Thursday, the state IBEW group let it be known that 
they would still not support the bill even with the Mid Am proposal.
Mid American believes that the Republicans now have a hook to force the 
democrats into voting for the de reg bill, by saying that if they don't vote 
affirmative, they are not for economic development in the rural/struggling 
areas of the state where the power plants would be built.  
WHile I may not share Mid American's positive assessment, the proponent's 
group continues it's advocacy and will meet with legilsators in their 
districts over the weekend. The senate leadership agreed to hold off 
reconvening the committee until Monday afternoon in an effort to allow any 
last minute maneuvering over the week end.

The latest from Des Moines.  The chair(republican) of the Senate committee 
had a hearing this morning to consider all of the enviromental amendments put 
forward by the Democrats and it was clear that no Dems would vote for the 
eventual bill without their amendments, so the chair recessed the committee 
without a vote.  The committee can be recalled at any time, but the general 
sense is that it will not be brought back up without at least 2 democrat 
votes guaranteed.  As is often the case in these debates, the proponents 
continue to try many strategies, but all of us agree that without direct 
intervention from Governor Vilsack, the democrats will not come around. As 
stated in my earlier message, I am not optimistic about passage.  Tempers are 
running very high and it is very possible that the utilities will try to cut 
a deal at the last minute that will negatively impact the customers (likely 
by rate impacts on envriomental/efficiency programs).  Please give me a call  
#612-339-4599 if you want any added insight.

Subject: Iowa de reg update
The Iowa customer choice bill has run into some significant roadblacks the 
last few days due to the political maneuvering of the Democrats.  As you will 
recall, the House Republicans have always stated that they needed Democrat 
votes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote.  Despite Governor 
Vilsack's stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend, 
the House  Democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members, as they 
want to use this bill against the Republicans in the House races this fall. 
(The tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the 
Southeastern part of the state due to the Republicans passing the bill).
The primary issue that the Dems are using as a reason not to vote for the 
bill is that the enviromental protections/funds are not high enough.  The 
Republicans are unhappy about the exhorbitant amount of funds and the RPS 
that are already in the bill, and are not willing to vote for an amended bill 
that the Dems are pushing for.  The enviros and the unions are, as they have 
been for the last 6 months, the dividing force in this debate.
Therefore, the proponents coalition moved their efforts to the Senate, with 
the hope of getting a vote out this week and then move it back over to the 
HOuse.  While we had a good commitment from Senate leadership (both Dems and 
Republicans) on Monday, that support has eroded as of this morning.  We are 
trying a number of tactics, and hope that there will be some positive 
movement today and tomorrow.  Without the Governor stepping up to the plate 
and ""encouraging"" the democrats to gather the number of democrat votes 
neccessary this week, I am not optimistic about passage.
There are still two-three weeks of session left, so this debate could rage 
until then, but my sense is that if we don't get something out of the Senate 
by the end of this week or early next week, we'll be dead.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Dave --
Do we have a strong preference for what DSTAR utilities should do?  I think that we want to communicate with OMTR and others at FERC to push a single RTO in the West (leaving CA) outside.  Also, having the Transco originally within the RTO West makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the Transco.
Jim

Importance:	High
To All,
Below is a message from Jack King the Chair of the DSTAR Board, which describes the dissolution of the DSTAR board due to the withdrawal of funding from the PTOs in the region.
The information I received on Wednesday from Cary Deise of APS was, on Monday the PTOs voted to withdraw funding of DSTAR (as noted below).  The big 5 in the region, APS, TEPCo, PNM, SRP and WAPA have, or plan, on signing a Memorandum Of Understanding to file with FERC on October 12 a complete tariff to form a for-profit TransCo called WesCo, or WestTrans, which will be based on the documents that we have been reviewing.  Cary noted that there are several possibilities for the proposed TransCo, one was to join TransConnect in the northwest and join RTO West, simply join RTO West, or develop their own compliant RTO.  Below Jack King states that the PTOs would be forming a for-profit RTO, that was NOT the impression I got from APS.  
I will keep you posted of any developments.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.
Kind Regards,
Dave

Message from Jack King, Chair of the Desert STAR Board of Directors:
I have been informed by the Transmission Owners that they plan to move
forward with a filing at FERC in the near future to create a for-profit
Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and that they do not intend to fund
any future activities of Desert STAR.  Without funding, the Desert STAR
Board of Directors feels that it has no choice but to start dissolving
Desert STAR.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank all of the
stakeholders for their support of Desert STAR and to wish all stakeholders
the best of fortune in this evolving environment.

Lee,
The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy 
the Enron project folks you have been dealing with.  
Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?  I would think that we 
could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be 
whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.  The banks won't care.
Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?

Please confirm that this will be the invoicing address for the 6 units bound
for Fountain Valley Project and 4 units pegged to LV Cogen Expansion.  Also,
we've still got a change order needed for Fountain Valley for the 6 Power
System Stabilizers and 2 Exhaust Stacks.  LV is also saying they will need 4
Power System Stabilizers, but haven't confirmed their order.

This deal has an NP delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!"
"Subject: NEPOOL
Body: Jim 	 Speaking with Don Miller last night he has indicated that Jeff McMahon would like to secure our membership and ongoing participation in NEPOOL and possibly other Pools, and is prepared to make cash available through the Cash Committee.
While we discussed a number of options, the starting point is to identify the contracts that are in the money to EPMI and which have not yet been terminated.
The long term deals that we have been looking at in NEPOOL are NSTAR, UI and CMP.
We are getting closer to an acceptable internal valuation of these and need to get a ""robust"" number that we can defend in order to release cash from the Cash Committee.
The three main cash related issues we need to address as I see it in the short term are: (1) We must provide NEPOOL with the comfort, possibly even in the form of a pre-pay, that we will pay our invoices for November, especially since the bonds we posted terminate on 29, December (2) We must provide cash collateral immediately and (3) We will need pay our NEPOOL invoices over a two, or possibly, one week period to reduce NEPOOL's exposure to EPMI.
This creates cash flow issues as we are only paid monthly by our customers.
With the one way payment issue we are facing with NSTAR and UI there is clearly little incentive for them to re-negotiate their contracts.
Turning to point (2), it is not clear to me whether we will be able to post the $137,390,360.10 and I will assume that we will not get the authority to post this but a lesser amount.
In trying to provide NEPOOL with comfort as to their exposures it may be that we can get them to agree that for the foreseeable future we will only be serving certain contracts and that the collateral requirement be based solely on EPMI serving those contracts.
I am not confident however that NEPOOL has the authority to what is in effect change the Financial Assurance Policy for one Participant, without approval of all Participants and approval of FERC, but we can explore this with them.
If the price of energy, ICAP and other services moves up then EPMI should be given a reasonable period of time to post further collateral.
That way we can hopefully reduce the initial amount we post and if the price moves up we can elect at that point whether to retain our membership or relinquish it.
While EPMI will be taking market risk, which ill not be hedged, it will have the ability to stop performing f the price moves against it.
It should not be forgotten that both the NSTAR and UI deals are one way payments and there is no time limit as to when either of these counterparties can claim a default due to EPMI's bankruptcy.
The effect of this being that we are at risk from a termination by these two counterparties at any time and since we are currently the ""Defaulting Party"" we would not receive any Early Termination Payment.
CMP is a two way payment and therefore there may well be some merit in entering into a term energy purchase deal to lock in value to this contract.
I am not aware of what EES is trying to do with NEPOOL, or the other pools in the North East, however I thought it would be helpful if they knew what we were trying to do and why.
Any input as to what EES is doing and any merit in a joint approach could be explored if both companies considered value could be achieved.
Finally, the recipients of this email will hopefully know of other people, for example in credit, scheduling and settlements who could assist in ensuring that we can accurately value and schedule the contracts we would like to continue performing under, please pass these on to Don Miller who is coordinating this initiative.
Regards,

Opt4 is currently interviewing for two software engineering positions.  Our
needs currently center on Java and integrating Java with Oracle, WebLogic,
and XML.  Your son looks like he may have background in those specific
frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration needs in a
few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new
interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job descriptions and
forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in Mathematica
(for the time being), but we have a full team.  If you son's work took him
into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in his
ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who know how
to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system designers at
IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro hard
drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to him.
Can you meet for dinner Monday or Wednesday night in Boston?

TJ,
 Could you please send this to the group.
The new intranet site (phase 1) is ready and can be viewed from the following 
link.
http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/portal/default.aspx
Many changes have taken place.  We have a new look and a new architecture.  
Currently the only changes you can make is to the color scheme.  You will 
notice 3 tabs across the top.  These will be configurable to your personal 
needs.  You will see that tab 3 is blank to show you that any content can be 
added.  Please take a look and give us feedback.  Without your input the site 
cannot grow to meet your needs.
Thanks,

Social Studies: Some Useful Definitions
Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.
Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and
sells you the milk.
Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.
Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income
Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. - No Balance Sheet provided with the release."

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-
+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett
The rest will be completed shortly.
We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Hi all,
We spoke to Rick Simpson in Hertzberg's office who related the
following:
The last meeting of Senate, Assembly, and Governor's staff was last
Wednesday.  The Senate staff has been advised that the Governor is not
interested in having a bill that could only pass the Senate.  He wants
one that can get 41 votes in the Assembly as well, which means direct
access would have to be included.  Rick spoke to Brian Kelly of Burton's
office on Friday.  Brian said they are working on securitizing the
interest costs.  They are looking at something like 50-60 kw for the
core/non-core number which would still be able to be financed even with
fewer customers, although the transaction costs would be higher with a
smaller customer base.  I asked Rick if they expect all of their members
to return and he said most of them would.  I suggested that it had
better be the right ones, or they'd have trouble getting to 41 votes.
He said he wasn't sure at this point if a compromise bill could be ready
by next Tuesday, but the Assembly is willing to try with the right bill.
I spoke to John Burton a few minutes ago who reiterated that he will not
look favorably upon including direct access although he understands that
some business democrats in the Assembly need it to vote for a
bailout.    He said he spoke to an Assembly leader this morning who told
him that even 78xx would get only 36 votes today if it came up for a
vote (it squeeked through on 41).  He is considering putting up 78xx for
a vote on Tuesday (it will fail) and continuing discussions with the
Governor's office after that.  He said to tell you all that the bailout
bill can't pass next week because it interferes with Scott and Gayle's
wedding on the 14th, and coincidentally that is the last day for the
Governor to sign or veto bills."

you the
information regarding a related initiative on which I have been working last 
year and which
is moving now into the implementation stage. It's Enterprise - Wide Risk 
Management
and it's really an effort to measure business risks consistently across the 
company.
I hope my group can be helpful in designing the general approach to this 
problem.
Please, let me know what your thoughts are.

I have a friend, Matt Whittaker,  that has a small power plant construction company.  They specialise in fast track projects using used turbines.  A small niche, but he has made some decent money doing it.  He asked me a few days ago if Enron would have any interest in a very small 35-40 MW project in California for a cement plant.  According to him, the cement plant is owned by Hanson plc and they have a site that has been permitted by the local air quality board for a used turbine that he has located and can have up and running by summer.  What he says they want is someone like Enron to develop the inside the fence plant and help them capture any upside from a potential expansion of the facility. (apparently the site is capable of supporting a larger facility, but that requires further permitting.)
I have done no independent verification of this and it may not be real, but thought you might be interested.  If so, Matt can be reached at 713-660-7171 office or 713-823-7222 cell.  Have whoever calls reference me.  If you are not interested, just let me know and I will tell him its of no interest.  If someone calls, please ask them to drop me an email so I can act like I know who they are if Matt brings it up.
Thanks and call if you have any questions.

"Subject: ... we definitely made some very bad investments ...
Body: Ken and Greg  I am part of the Enron Tax Department, assigned currently to Enron Global Assets, previously to Enron India.
Your comment regarding the very bad investments Enron made in international assets is absolutely true.
Perhaps the assets themselves are not all that bad, Enron just over-paid, over-built or over-leveraged.
In some cases, I suspect we did all three!
But that's not the point of this message.
When you make statements like you did in yesterday's Investor conference call it erodes EGA's ability to sell those assets (who wants to buy a very bad investment ?)
and chokes the spirit of the employees who have remained loyal to Enron and continue to support the needs of EGA.
The 100 or so members in the EGA support group did not make the bad decisions.
Those were made by former and current executives, RAC, Enron's Board of Directors, and others who were well-qualified to make such decisions.
I cannot begin to tell you how hard Tax, Legal, Accounting, PR, etc.
worked to make the best of what often-times looked to us to be a stupid if not bad investment.
Many of those who remain have devoted several years to Enron's international experiment.
We've given up dinner with our families, weekend soccer games and campouts, in many cases we have even sacrificed our good health.
I suspect we will continue to make those sacrifices in order to close asset sales and efficiently return to Enron the remaining value.
Please, when you proclaim to the World the very bad investments Enron made, take some time to remind those of us who are left to unwind these investments that Enron is fortunate to have some very bright and dedicated employees diligently working to contain the damage already done.
Sincerely,
"

We have had recurring problems with Morgan's west power group(scheduling, 
real time, anyone) being absolutely unreachable after 2 pm our time, for any 
reason.  
Geir had a number of their schedules have difficulty this weekend, and called 
me in desperation for a way to reach them. I have spoken to Morgan's staff 
numerous times about their unavailability, and those conversations seem to 
have no impact.
Today it presents a problem because  one of their tags is denied, and there 
is nobody there to fix them. They did not correct their tag, and I had to 
intervene and create one on their behalf and deal with the control area at 5 
pm.
Please keep these diffuculties in mind, and if you have any influence with 
their trading staff, encourage them to beef up their staffing, especially on 
real time.

Attached please find 2 draft letter to send to acquiring shippers with copies 
to releaseing shippers.
Letter A is to go to those shippers that have not paid the November 
invoices.  Pursuant to the tariff, Northern can give notice to terminate the 
service agreement.  At such point, the service agreement reverts back to the 
releasing shipper.The letter includes a notice that we consider the agreement 
extended to 2003 per the rate case even without their execution.
Letter B is to go to those acquiring shippers that paid the November 
invoices.  For those service agreement with an original expiration date of 
10/31/99, the payment constitutes acknowledgement that the agreement 
continues to 2002 pursuant to the administrative amendment that extended the 
agreement pursuant to the rollover provisions.  The letter includes a notice 
that we consider the agreement extended to 2003 per the rate case even 
without their execution.
Do we want to add to both letters that if the amendment is not executed, 
Northern will consider the releases temporary and the entitlement will revert 
back to the releasing shipper by x date?  or do we want to just wait until 
11/1/02 and see what happens.  (the revert back maybe should be in a separate 
letter to the Releasing Shipper otherwise the acquiring shipper will just do 
nothing and we'll be fighting with the releasing shipper anyway.  I'm 
rambling but hopefully you get the jist. 
Please let me have your comments ASAP because I don't know when 30 days from 
the invoice runs out.  Considering they have ten days to pay and we know they 
haven;t paid, we for sure only have 20 days.  Thanks, Dari"

		 Subject: Alberta PPA Financing
I thought I might try to sum up.  It seems to me that we both need to 
finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that 
we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of 
next week.
1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap 
structure including the credit and covenant package.
2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have 
one prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global 
Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its 
external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, 
documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or 
exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among 
each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless 
and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and 
financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations 
are, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For 
example:
 (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee 
they were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to 
accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking 
for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and 
warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon 
this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may 
have a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by 
voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a 
long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact 
been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank.
 (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I 
now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law.
 (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of 
enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect 
to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron 
Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect 
to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable.
 (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to 
me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to 
Enron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal 
opinions.
 (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of 
the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I 
suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.
 (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the 
Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of 
Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.
 (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this 
afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This 
presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps 
involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At 
the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be 
capable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation 
through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.
 (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on 
the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent 
upon a final understanding of the swap structure.
 (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not 
clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap 
structure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the 
principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate 
""fee letter"" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not 
clear as to how ""increased costs"" would be accounted for in the swap 
structure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions 
that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a 
change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those 
increased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be 
accommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to 
fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes 
or through a separate indemnification in the ""fee letter"".
 (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the 
paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For 
example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements 
and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in 
Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have 
already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs 
to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the 
Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on 
finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants 
package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, 
that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same 
as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank 
of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper 
as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon 
as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.
Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a 
measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external 
expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all 
relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday 
morning.
Regards,
Peter"

***********************************************************************
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY INVESTMENT CHALLENGE--EXPECTATIONS MEET NEW REALITIES
Between 1998 and 2001, investors poured some US$4.36 billion into companies
developing distributed energy (DE) technologies. This investment boom and the
subsequent capital market correction were created by overly optimistic
expectations regarding the size of the opportunity and speed of the market's
development.
*  DE's failure to capture a substantial portion of the California market
during the power crisis in early 2001 and the collapse of the
telecommunications and information technology sectors undermined investors'
confidence. Shifting power market fundamentals and growing uncertainty over the
pace and direction of regulatory change also contributed.
*  Although the short-term market for DE technologies has suffered, in the long
run the revised expectations are part of a healthy trend toward greater
maturity among companies and their backers.
*  Restricted access to capital will slow commercialization of new technologies
and drive consolidation among energy technology companies. Public policy will
become an increasingly important source of funds and other support in the
future.

Guys--
First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)
Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.
 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.
Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.
O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??
As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. 
A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an ""Enron brain drain"" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).   
The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.
ALL comments solicited----
Many thanks!!
--Christie.

Christie,
Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the ""From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop"" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.
Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites

		 Subject: Crescendo Noms on NWPL
Mark,
I spoke to Liz Orr this morning regarding the status of nominating the 
Crescendo gas on NWPL.  Due to a couple of the interconnects constrained into 
NWPL due to high hydrocarbons there is only one delivery point available to 
flow into NWPL (Foundation Creek).  They are holding space for actual 
producers behind Foundation Creek to flow into NWPL and the remaining 40% of 
capacity for the other producers.  Cresendo's pro-rata share into NWPL would 
be 1,000 MMbtu/day.  Interruptible transport is flowing into NWPL. 
Liz also said they are very close to having the Grand Valley point back in 
spec for quality which will increase our flow into NWPL up to 2,000 
MMBtu/day.  She's hopeful for the end of the week for this increase.
The meter number on NWPL for Foundation Creek is Map Pt. 56 (meter 48010 on 
Wildhorse).
We will be trying 1,000 for tomorrow's gas day into NWPL and will keep 
everyone informed when we can increase to 2,000.
Please call me with any questions at (303) 575-6485.
Thanks,
Theresa"

A phone call was held today.  Some issues / actions from the call ---
1. Right now it appears that this would be announced around June 5 at the 
Mayor's regular press meeting.  Checking this out.  Need to make sure that PR 
will be able to cover the meeting and answer any background the press may 
have on us.
2. Deal team wants Enron PR to meet with DEP PR next week (May 30?) to begin 
working up the Mayor's statement on the benefits of this transaction.  Should 
we have a Govt Affairs person at the meeting to pick up the ""politics"" of the 
message?  Just a thought.
3. No one really wants to hire any outside PR support.  Everyone was 
comfortable with Peggy and her team taking the lead.  Don't want to appear 
that Enron is ""selling"" the deal.  The deal is good and we should let it 
speak for itself.  Does everyone agree?
4. We are looking for a consultant  to support us on MWBE issues.  This 
should be done (at least contracted) by June 1.
5. What have we told outside political support about this deal (eg, Piper, 
Marbury)?  Sue Landwehr and Roy we need to make sure that you have some time 
the week of June 5 to cover any political issues that may arise.  Can we 
coordinate our schedules?
Thanks,
Jim"

Subject: Update on FERC California Gas/Electric Matters
Body: 
Below is a copy of the Order lifting the $250/Mwh hard price cap for 
California ISO/PX.
FERC has also posted a notice of a  Dec. 15 special mtg. re the investigation 
into the California market last summer.
Various Enron units continue to receive informal data requests from FERC 
staff regarding current California gas/electric 
Steve Kean has asked that all inquiries be coordinated through Sarah Novosel 
in the DC office.
Leslie Lawner is preparing Enron's response to the SDG&E emergency petition 
to put a cap on gas sales.
 
              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS
          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     today approved a price cap change requested by the California
     Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.
          The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  
          The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in California.
          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   
          The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.
          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   
          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     California QF.
          The orders are effective immediately.

Mary,
HPLC currently has a gas purchase agreement (global #96014987) in place with 
Calpine that extends through 5/31/2001.  Sitara deal no. 133259 correctly has 
this contract attached to it.  Effective 11/1/1998 the contract was amended 
releasing Gouger wells no. 5 & 6.  These wells were apparently the only 
producing wells behind this point.  Evidence being no measured volumes in 
MIPS.  There are however other non producing wells behind this point.  Is 
your Sept & Oct UA4 issue the direct result of volumes being scheduled at 
meter no. 4229?  If so, for November, the nom at this point will be taken to 
1mmbtu/d until the wells behind this point began to produce.
As far as meter 6835 (Roos #1 C/P) is concerned, HPLC also has a contract 
(#96003771) in place with Cokinos Nat Gas that is currently in an ""evergreen"" 
status.  The aforementioned wells were released from the Calpine contract; 
however, they were not added behind meter 6835.  Therefore, I do not agree 
that the deal (133259) should be edited to change the meter.
Hopefully this information is useful!

I am not sure who should handle this, so, I shared the ""wealth"".  On deal 
ticket 133259, purchase from Calpine, the deal is input at meter 4229, which, 
per the email below, was terminated.  I have an unresolvable UA4 issue at 
meter 4229 for September and for October.  I have changed the meter 
designation for November forward, however, I receive an error in Sitara when 
I attempt to change either the prior or current month.  This deal should have 
been changed to meter 6835 effective back in February of this year.  Please 
let me know what I can do to resolve this issue ASAP. 
Thanks,
Mary

Cheryl,
FYI  - Here is the message from Mary Poorman in Logistics.  
Mary,
Cheryl is going to call the field and find out if this meter should still be 
included on the termination list and also see if the field people see any gas 
flow on the meter.
Thanks,

Kathy and I are trying to clean up an unaccounted for issue at the above 
referenced meter.  The system (Pops) does not show a BAV flow or an actual 
flow for prior months.  Kathy phoned measurement to inquire about Mips 
volumes and was informed that this meter is on a disabled status list back to 
February, 2000.  I am showing a purchase from Calpine at this meter (deal 
ticket 133259) on gathering agreement 
I would greatly appreciate your help in determining the current status of 
this meter and this deal.  Please forward any information you may have.
Thank you for your time and patience,

Body: Brent:    In order to track the proliferation of electronic trading agreements,  licensing/software agreements and electronic platforms, we (Sam, Stephanie  and me) have established a ""process"" which includes the following:  1.  sending immediate email to Ted Murphy, legal and credit (Bradford) from  the commercial group identifying the Enron party needing the agreement, and  necessity for agreement  2.  depending on the type of agreement, credit may or may not need to get  involved.
3.  the paralegals enter the agreement onto Lotus Notes so that we can track  the process.
4.  upon execution, a copy of the agreement is kept in a red file (near Sam's  desk), a copy is sent to Ted Murphy, and the original is sent to global  contracts.
To my knowledge, we have not established a procedure for tracking passwords  (to the extent required/changed).
I understand that Jason is handling three ENA weather license agreements for  you (Risk Management Solutions,Inc., Foresight Weather LLC and Air Worldwide  Weather).
Jason has (or will have) access to Lotus Notes to enter his  comments.

Dave
One of my close friends is looking for a job. He has been in strategy consulting for the last four years, first for Mckinsey and then for Accenture. He is a very smart guy and has great business sense. I have known him for a long time, great guy and can get things done. 
He is a business strategy and restructuing guru. Gurmeet had a baby and he is very keen in moving out of consulting. I am enclosing his resume here and I am going to take the liberty of asking him to give you a call. Will appreciate your taking a look.

In short, if the carrier pays out anything, they hold subrogation rights; however, the longer answer is much more complicated, of course. Please feel free to call Eileen (37535) or me and we will be glad to discuss further.

If the carrier pays to settle the case on behalf of the directors or officers does it thereby gain any subrogation rights against any third parties.  For example, would it mean the carrier, and not the company, would own the cause of action against AA? "

Subject: OMLX - Re: Revised ENRON CLICK Licence
Body: 
Mark,
See message below, just in from Susan Gill.
I have attached her revised version of the Click Agreement for your ease of 
reference from which you will see that the OM has now adopted the position 
per the OMNet Agreement of a very limited form of limitation of liability 
clause - but at least it is mutual.
I don't think that we are going to get any further with the OM on this one.  
My view would be that we will need to accept this if we are going to want to 
join up.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
Kind regards
Mark

Subject:  Re: ENRON electronic agreements
Susan,
I have spoken to Houston overnight on your revised documents and we do take
issue with one point - that is the failure of OM to agree to insert our
requested limitation of liability clause in Enron's favour in the OM Click 
Trade
Application (NT) Licence Agreement, whereas such a clause exists in OM 
Gruppen's
favour in that document (see Clause 5.3).
We make the following points:-
1.   We notice that OM has agreed at least to a certain form of mutual
limitation of liability clause in the OMNet Agreement and therefore we find 
it a
little odd that OM is unable to agree to any mutual limitation of liability
clause in the OM Click Trade Application Licence.   We should be very grateful
if OM would explain to us its reasoning for this in detail.
2.   In any event, it is entirely against Enron's legal policy to enter into
agreements containing merely a unilateral limitation of liability clause
protecting the other party.  Accordingly, we are not prepared to enter into 
the
OM Click Trade Application Licence in your current revised format.
I therefore attach, once again, as a Word document the text of Enron's 
required
clause on limitation of liability which I would suggest is added to the OM 
Click
Trade Application Licence as Clause 5.4.
(See attached file: OM Click Trade Licence Agreement - Rider.doc)
Once OM is in a position to agree to our required language, we should then be 
in
a position to execute the documentation.
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Kind regards
Mark

These guys move fast.  Besides requiring a little editing, I told Allegheny that we would prefer to wait till Monday so that we have time to place phone calls to agencies/gov officials in Nevada before it hits the wires.  I dont think we need to mention Enron in the release.  I will copy you on a later draft.

Per my voicemail, attached is the Press Release regarding Allegheny's 15-year natural gas tolling agreement with Enron's Las Vegas Congeneration facility. Please note that Enron is NOT mentioned in the release.  
According to Allegheny, this deal was closed this morning at 6am. At this point, Allegheny is not sure if they are even going to issue this release, but they would like our approval just in case they decide to move forward and release it. If they do decide to issue the release, they are aiming to do so TODAY. Therefore, please provide your comments to me asap.

who 
failed to comply with Schedule 2. Section 4.3.2. of the PX  Tariff which 
states, 
""All payments by  the PX Participants shall be made to the PX Clearing 
Account 
via the Fedwire System for funds to be received at the PX  Clearing Account 
no 
later than noon PPT on  the Payment Due Date."" 
Additionally, Schedule 2, Section 5.5 of the PX  Tariff requires the PX to 
identify such  Participants to all other affected PX Participants by the most 
expeditious means available.? In accordance with Section  5.5, here is a list 
of

?? American Electric Power Service  Corporation 
?? Arizona Public  Service 
?? Los Angeles Department  of Water and Power 
?? Pacific Gas  & Electric 
?? Sacramento  Municipal Utility District 
?? Salt  River Project 
Each PX Participant's pro-rata portion of the  shortfall from the 
Participants 
mentioned  above will be communicated to them individually in the next couple 
of  
days.? If you should have questions, please  call Clark Cheng at 626-537-3243

From: susan.scott@enron.com
Subject: Gallup answers
Body: 
Here is the quick & dirty.
None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not 
placed in service by a certain date.  The respective obligations of the 
parties do not commence until the facilities are ""tested and placed in 
service.""  We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the 
facilities were in service.  The compressor has since been taken down because 
of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.  
EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do 
not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.  Based on our 
experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.  Today, 
we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not 
exceed our existing capacity.  Nominations are expected to exceed existing 
capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.
Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be 
best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are 
not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our 
best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.    When the 
compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.  
The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.  (estimated loss:  
$25,000/month)
The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers.
From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to 
revoke our ""in-service"" announcement.  When summer weather kicks in, we'll 
probably have to allocate every day.  On our EBB we will have to give some 
reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an 
explanation anyway).  Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be 
triggered.  
The downside:  shippers will never trust us again.  Also, we could be subject 
to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was ""in 
service"" when we knew it was not.  
The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at 
least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent 
deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of 
longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.  (In 
July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not 
delivered).  We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs 
full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption 
in mind.
Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a 
memo for wider distribution, let me know.  For now, I think it's important to 
get a decision on one of the above options.  The longer we wait to get 
information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will 
be.  "

um excuse me sir, but i think that you stood me up twice and you never call me back.  so i just decided to stop being part of your enterage.  wade and i are trying to work through things, but i guess that we are getting along a little better.  we have one more hole in our wall and i haven't broken any phones lately so i guess that is a good sign.  we still have a long way to go.  so why haven't i heard from you little one?

My name is Shelly Jones, I am the analyst recruiting manager for the 
Associate/Analyst Program.  Christy Young passed on information from the 
University of Houston AIESEC program.  Due to the restructuring of the 
Associate/Analyst Program and the new policies regarding the interview 
process, compensation, offers, etc., we will not be participating in the 
AIESEC Program this year.  Due to your past interest in the program, I have 
forwarded the literature on to you, via inter-office mail, for your 
consideration. 
Please contact me if you have any questions. 
Thank you for your time.

we'll call you.  Jeff, I don't know if you're available, but if you've got a

the Hearing.  Glen, I'll call you also.
Kim, Steve, if you guys want to sit-in, we'll make the call from one of the

In our meeting this week, I forgot to mention that we need to move the accounting responsibility for Onondaga from the gas group over to Chris Sherman and Billy Fleenor. Billy wanted me to check with you before they move it. If you're ok with this, please send me a return e-mail.

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.  
 
Bill

Ridota's a tough customer.  Very political type--knee-capper from the Wilson administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc.  DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.  May want to add the great job Davis did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.  Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices.

Subject:  Dinner with Tom DeLay and others on April 6th -- additional infor
      mation
To:  Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer
The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.
BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area
on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.
APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.
He has asked to end the day with a ""small dinner with CEOs"" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and
advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before
or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.
RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies
to
attend the dinner.
My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at
a
board member's home nearby.
I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
carefully....
SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW

NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW

 Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak
If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
him to do the same.

Not sure - I can't plan that far ahead at the moment.  We are just in the final stages of getting the part of the business I work for sold and therefore out of bankruptcy - I work for a company called Enron which has gone bankrupt.  We have just sold the trading piece to UBS so we are in the process of transfer and I have no idea what the new bosses will be like.
Are you going?

Subject: CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring
Here's the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that 
will appear in Monday's CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward (there is 
a hard copy in your box).
CQ WEEKLY - ENERGY 
Apr. 22, 2000 
Page 949 
Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric> Deregulation
By James C. Benton, CQ Staff 
At the dawn of the year, it seemed Congress would be content to let the 
current session end without moving legislation to encourage further 
deregulation of the nation's $220 billion <electric> market. But developments 
in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation, 
as well as the Clinton administration, are building a consensus that will put 
pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year.
On April 6, a group called the <Electricity> Restructuring Stakeholders -- 
representing consumers, <electric> generating companies, senior citizens and 
others -- released a set of goals they believe should be included in 
restructuring legislation. The principles include repeal of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (<PUHCA>) and changes to a 1978 law (PL 
95-617) that required state utility commissions and <utilities> to reform 
their <electric> rates and take other measures to even out daily <electric> 
consumption. (1978 CQ Almanac, p. 639)
The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify 
other areas where common ground can be reached, said Joe Nipper, chief 
lobbyist for the American Public Power Association.
A smaller trade group, composed mainly of investor-owned <utilities>, is 
working on its own set of principles.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an 
April 17 speech to the National Energy Marketers Association, and he urged 
Congress to pass an <electric> restructuring bill.
""Our interstate <electricity> markets are in need of repair,"" Richardson 
said, adding that <transmission> access and generation capacity are 
decreasing as demand for <electricity> grows. ""If Congress fails to act -- 
and act soon -- on restructuring legislation, it will strangle the 
development of competitive <electricity> markets.""
The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan 
have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the 106th Congress. But 
they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar, 
election-year politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues 
on how to rewrite or repeal <PUHCA>.
On April 27, Senate Energy Chairman Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, will hold 
the last of three hearings on eight <electric> deregulation-related measures.
On the House side, retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., 
R-Va., has vowed to work toward enacting a bill (HR 2944) to encourage 
further state deregulation of the <electric> utility market. That measure, 
which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone, not 
just the nearest utility, was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on 
Energy and Power on Oct. 27. (CQ Weekly, p. 478; 1999 CQ Weekly, p. 2599)
The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a 
competitive market but contains no deadline, or ""date certain,"" by which 
states would have to restructure.
Moving a Senate Bill
Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome 
this year. For example, while they have made progress on principles, the key 
negotiators -- representing investor-owned <utilities>; <electric> 
cooperatives; municipal <electric> <utilities>; large <electricity> 
consumers; labor unions, and environmental groups -- still must reach 
consensus on details the legislation should address, as well as the 
legislative language to implement any agreement.
""I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low, not from 
the lack of trying,"" Nipper said.
The best chance appears to lie in the Senate, where Murkowski's committee is 
considering eight bills. ""I am committed to getting something meaningful out 
of my committee,"" Murkowski said in an April 14 interview. Murkowski 
acknowledged, though, that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on 
each of the bills pose challenges to his goal -- developing a comprehensive 
deregulation bill, not one that only addresses portions of <electric> 
restructuring.
The path in the House appears more difficult, although one key supporter said 
there is behind-the-scenes movement.
Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR 2944 before Memorial Day, and he 
has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee.
Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, the sponsor of HR 2944, said meetings are taking 
place among Bliley, Republican House staffers and some interested groups. 
""There is some action; it's just not visible,"" Barton said late last month. 
""I think what's happening there is that [stakeholders are] jockeying for 
position.""
Barton said he anticipated that a ""fairly good bill"" could be moved by the 
middle of May if stakeholders and members come together.
One complication: Democrats, in the midst of the battle to regain control of 
the House, may not move toward a consensus with Republicans. Staff aides for 
several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from 
the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee.
But others point to a 1992 energy law (PL 102-486) that cleared Congress in 
the weeks before that year's election. It contained provisions allowing <
utilities> and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power 
market; that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in 
some markets. So far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have either 
restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in 
coming years. (1992 Almanac, p. 231)
Mark Stultz, a spokesman for the <Electric> <Power> Supply Association, a 
group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers, said the 1992 law 
was enacted after the <electric> industry quickly built up a consensus among 
members and educated them on what the bill would do.
""The industry was able to access that in a very short time,"" Stultz said. As 
far as getting a restructuring bill through this year, Stultz said it is ""not 
an impossible, unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus,"" 
since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues. They include 
blocking ""market power"" -- the ability of a few companies to stunt 
competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated 
market to its advantage.
While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with, Stultz 
said it also contains some fatal flaws. He cited as an example its lack of 
federal agency jurisdiction over ""bundled"" services in a regulated market, in 
which <electric> generation, <transmission> and distribution rates are 
combined in an <electric> bill, and ""unbundled"" services in a deregulated 
market, in which the generation rates are broken apart from <transmission> 
and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation 
are included.
Best Bets in the Senate
Of the eight bills pending in the Senate, Nipper said the one with the best 
chance of passing is S 2071, sponsored by Slade Gorton, R-Wash., which is 
intended to encourage greater <electric> <reliability>. Nipper said the 
Gorton bill would replace the North American <Electric> <Reliability> 
Council, a group in which utility participation is voluntary, with the <
Electric> <Reliability> Organization, a board that would require 
participation by <utilities>. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would 
have jurisdiction over the board, as well as the power to enforce its 
policies on <utilities>.
The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months, due to 
problems <electric> <utilities> faced each of the past two summers. While 
some plants were undergoing needed maintenance, some <utilities> were caught 
with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand. 
The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk <electric> prices, driving 
the price of a megawatt-hour of <electricity> in a few places from $30 to as 
high as $7,000. <Utilities> enforced rotating blackouts on customers, asked 
consumers to reduce <electric> use and passed on surcharges for the higher 
cost of <electricity>.
Hoping to avoid outages this summer, the Department of Energy has scheduled 
four regional ""summits"" on <electric> <reliability> on April 24 and 28.
Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison <Electric> Institute, said a third 
consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases 
could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill. ""It might push this 
thing up further on the congressional radar screen,"" although a law enacted 
immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and <transmission> 
reliability, he said.
Other thorny issues include:
? How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned <utilities>, <electric
> cooperatives and municipal <utilities>, and whether <utilities> should 
voluntarily join, or be forced to join, ""regional <transmission> 
organizations"" designed to allow more efficient transfer of <electricity> 
across the national grid.
? Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the 
interstate <transmission> of <electric> <power>. Some stakeholders argue 
federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from 
protecting its customers at the expense of others.
? Environmental groups' desire for stronger anti-pollution restrictions on <
utilities> that produce pollutants while generating <electricity>. And labor 
groups, wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through 
corporate mergers and acquisitions, want to make sure their union members are 
protected."

                           READ ALL THE WAY TO THE END-THERE'S A TRICK TO IT. 
                           Finally a Barbie I can relate to.    At long last, here are some NEW 
                           Barbie dolls to coincide with her and OUR aging gracefully. These 
                           are a bit more realistic... 
                           1. Bifocals Barbie.     Comes with her own set of blended-lens 
                           fashion frames 
                           in six wild colors (half-frames too!), neck chain, and large-print 
                           editions   of  Vogue and Martha Stewart Living. 
                           2. Hot Flash Barbie.      Press Barbie's bellybutton and watch her 
                           face  turn 
                           beet red while tiny drops of perspiration appear on her forehead. 
                           Comes with handheld fan and tiny tissues. 
                           3. Facial Hair Barbie.     As Barbie's hormone levels shift, see her 
                           whiskers 
                           grow.   Available with teensy tweezers and magnifying mirror. 
                           4. Flabby Arms Barbie.     Hide Barbie's droopy triceps with these 
                           new,roomier-sleeved gowns.   Good news on the tummy front, 
                           two-MuMus with tummy-support panels are included. 
                           5. Bunion Barbie.    Years of disco dancing in stiletto heels have 
                           definitely 
                           taken their toll on Barbie's dainty arched feet. Soothe her sores with 
                           the 
                           pumice stone and plasters, then slip on soft terry mules. 
                           6. No-More-Wrinkles Barbie.     Erase those pesky crow's-feet and 
                           lip lines 
                           with a tube of Skin Sparkle-Spackle, from Barbie's own line of 
                           exclusive 
                           age-blasting cosmetics. 
                           7. Soccer Mom Barbie.     All that experience as a cheerleader is 
                           really paying 
                           off as Barbie dusts off her old high school megaphone to root for 
                           Babs and 
                           Ken, Jr.    Comes with minivan in robin-egg blue or white and cooler 
                           filled with 
                           doughnut holes and fruit punch. 
                           8. Mid-life Crisis Barbie.      It's time to ditch Ken. Barbie needs a 
                           change, 
                           and Alonzo (her personal trainer) is just what the doctor ordered, 
                           along with 
                           Prozac. They're hopping in her new red Miata and heading for the 
                           Napa 
                           Valley to open a B&B.     Includes a real tape of ""Breaking Up Is 
                           Hard to Do."" 
                           9. Divorced Barbie.     Sells for$ 199.99.   Comes with Ken's house, 
                           Ken's car, 
                           and Ken's boat. 
                           10. Recovery Barbie.     Too many parties have finally caught up 
                           with the 
                           ultimate party girl.    Now she does Twelve Steps instead of dance 
                           steps.   Clean 
                           and  sober, she's going to meetings religiously.   Comes with a little 
                           copy of 
                           The Big Book and a six-pack of Diet Coke. 
                           11. Post-Menopausal Barbie.     This Barbie wets her pants when 
                           she sneezes, 
                           forgets where she puts things, and cries a lot.     She is sick and 
                           tired of Ken 
                           sitting on the couch watching the tube, clicking through the 
                           channels.     Comes 
                           with Depends and Kleenex. As a bonus this year, the book ""Getting 
                           In Touch with Your Inner Self"" is included. 
  
                          The one I got said that if you forward to 11 people a very funny; video comes on your screen.   Who knows?  I just thought it was cute."

Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the 
Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.  I 
see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.  I 
also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and 
not loose any capability.  Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH 
by at least a third to one-half.  Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?

Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on 
whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale 
businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.  
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this 
needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the 
first world is out this week.  I ask for your patience.  
Lets discuss.
Regards
Delainey

Draft memo on the functional alignment of South America under the new 
organization.  Would like to send out to the South America organization 
tonight to give people partial information on work in progress.  Silence is 
bothering people a lot and the company is at risk of losing people.  
Definitive organization memo out in the coming days, after complete 
coordination with wholesale and retail in Houston.  Look at the first version 
of the memo.  Please reply with any comments asap."

I will order the wine tomorrow if you really will be by on Sunday.  I can
only have 2 cases delivered at a time.  So I'll get the Coastal first.  It
comes to $152.74 (less $80) = $72.74
The 97 cab will be $193.50
Total = $266.24

Just let me know (though we love to keep it).  We're allegedly going to

Sunday.  But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it

PARTIES:
This is a reminder that PG&E will host a Gas Accord II Settlement Workshop
next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, November 7th and 8th.  Please note, the
workshops will start promptly at 9:00 a.m. each day, and end around 4:00

feedback from the parties.  With this earlier start, we will provide a
continental breakfast as well as lunch on both days.  The Workshop will be
held at PG&E's headquarters, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.  We will be in
Conference Room 308 on Tuesday, and Conference Room 300 on Wednesday.
Please RSVP to Darcy Morrison, at e-mail D2Mr@pge.com, or by telephone at
(415) 973-6644, so that we can get a head-count for the meals.
Attached below is our proposed agenda for the November 7-8 Workshop.  The
topics include:  demand-supply forecast, supply reliability, capital cost
forecast, and backbone direct connection and local transmission rate design
options.  Although these subjects have been discussed at prior workshops,
our objective is to present additional detail and analysis so we can all
wrestle with some key issues and begin to formulate possible solutions.
Also, as we discussed at the last Workshop, we have set aside two hours at
the end of each day for observations and feedback from the parties.  Along
with the issues list, this will help PG&E to put together a proposal that
seeks to balance the many competing interests.
This is our last scheduled Workshop before we send out our first version of
a settlement proposal.  Our target date for this proposal remains December
8.
We look forward to seeing you next week.  Please call or E-mail us if you
have any questions or suggestions.

Sounds good to me, although we are likely to find different purchasers want

A letter whereby a party agrees that in the event of a change of control of 
its counterparty, it will not use such change of control event as a basis for 
challenging the enforceability of the agreement that it has with the 
counterparty.  At least in our context this is what Fred means by estoppel 
letter.  He has a very good point that we should incorporate this concept 
into our further assurances clause in our option agreements.

Good News!!!  The termination spreadsheets have been updated.  There are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial.  Will Smith has moved a new version of Deal Liquidation into stage for us to use going forward.  It incorporates both his script for moving deals to Bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates.  Please look at this so we can use it on our updates.

Subject: ARTO Progress
A quick update on ARTO....
Since taking the reigns from Jeff we have been concentrating on getting a 
seat at the table with ARTO to discuss day 2 congestion mgmt (CM).  We have 
been (tentatively) successful (i.e. we have a toe in the door but not a seat 
at the table).
? Initially ARTO were not interested in pursuing a stakeholder process to 
discuss market design issues. They held a stakeholder meeting in Columbus on 
3/22 where we suggested that they set up a meaningful stakeholder process.  
This was supported by a majority of stakeholders at the meeting.   However it 
appeared to fall on deaf ears.
? As a result of that meeting we assisted EPSA draft a letter to the ARTO 
mgmt committee setting out our concerns and proposing a stakeholder process 
that if implemented would avoid us going to FERC (the threat was implicit in 
the letter).
? ARTO held a second stakeholder meeting in Baltimore.  At that meeting they 
proposed a stakeholder process along the lines set out in the EPSA letter 
(the Market Development Advisory Group will meet every two weeks to reach 
concensus on day 2 CM).  We also suggested a tentative governance structure 
and a way of ensuring that ARTO fully considered our input.  While it is 
unclear whether ARTO are 'genuinely' seeking input from this group or trying 
to appease FERC, the setting up of the process is a useful step for us.  We 
can use the process to attempt to gain concensus around a fully developed 2 
day CM solution, propose this to ARTO and work with them on implementation by 
12/15/2002.   If ARTO refuse to adopt it we should have a stronger case with 
FERC as we will be able to show the process, output and lack of consideration 
by ARTO.  I am sure that ARTO are aware of this so i am trying to work out 
their angle, maybe they are being genuine (still it pays to be a sceptic at 
this stage).
? To start building concensus around a day 2 CM solution i have asked a small 
group of stakeholders to assist us develop a framework (at this stage the 
small goup is Edison Mission, Constellation, Duke Energy, PG&E and Reliant).  
They are happy for us to take the lead on developing this framework (no 
prizes for anyone who guesses what that framework looks like) and to start 
thinking about how we get wider concensus amongst stakeholders.
So some positive movement.  I am also opening up communications with ARTO 
mgmt committee members (have talked to Comed and started with Illinois Power 
through Dynegy....Ron & I are trying to set up a second meeting with AEP 
mgmt) and Janine is setting up a roadshow so we can visit other interested 
parties in the ARTO region over May/June.
A couple of other related points.  It would be useful to get in front of the 
decision makers at Dynegy to see where they are at generally...there is some 
differing feedback from the people i know so it is not clear what their 
corporate position is (i may need a hand here!).  This is reflected in the 
second point...at the last ARTO stakeholder mtg we were told that ARTO had to 
make a decision whether to select 'pay as bid' or 'single market clearing 
price' as the mechanism to determine price discovery.  We were told that 7 
out of the 10 ARTO mgmt commttee preferred 'pay as bid'.  Anyway we argued 
for 'single market clearing price'.  We also suggested that transmission 
owners should not make a decision that affected market participants.  We 
managed to convince a some stakeholder with our arguments and ARTO held a 
spot vote that recorded 3 for 'pay as bid', 9 for 'single market clearing 
price and 9 'not enough info'....i have heard to ARTO took this into account 
and will leave it to stakeholders which again is a positive step for the 
process. I strongly supported 'single market clearing price' whereas Dynegy 
was a strong proponent for 'pay as bid' but having talked to their people in 
Houston they say that that is not their position (its seems like they have 
the same problem as other large firms....).  So getting time with their 
decision makers would be useful.
I hope this update is useful, give me a call with any queries or feedback.
regards
MR
Christi, could you forward this to the traders if you think it is useful for 
them."

morning.  Gerald researched the gathering contracts and found that they are 
mostly in $/mmbtu instead of $/mcf.  This knocks down the value of gathering 
all the entrada reserves down by about $2mm and thus total value is now at 
~$8mm.  The value of the Dakota gas is not impacted much."

Subject: An opportunity to contribute to Global IP Carriers 2002 programme,
Body: 
 17-19 April 2002, The Royal Garden Hotel, London...
Dear Mr Skilling,
As conference director for Global IP Carriers 2002, I would like to speak to
you to discuss the focus of next year's conference programme and to discuss
speaking opportunities at the event. It is a well established event for IP
wholesale and IP carriers infrastructure market and I would expect 100+
delegates for next year's conference. A tightly focused programme is most
crucial at this stage and this is the initial reason for contacting you as a
player within the marketplace.
IP networks are capable of delivering cost control and new revenues to
carriers. Internet traffic will grow, albeit not as fast as previously
predicted and we are moving towards all IP networks, certainly for the new
carriers. The areas that I would like to discuss with you cover a broad
range and if you would like to respond only on certain topics that is fine -
all feedback is invaluable for focusing the programme. The broad areas to be
covered include -
Quality of service - what architectures deliver? MPLS vs Diffserv? Gigabit
Ethernet vs ATM?
Service provisioning - areas of growth for service providers and will there
be self provisioning?
What methods of diffentiation are IP carriers at the edge of the network?
Bundling of services - challenges and opportunities
Customer loyalty and churn - strategies for building customer bases and CRM
Areas for revenue growth - value added services that will grow your revenue
IP VPNs - are they the killer app that will encourage enterprises to pay for
new fiber?
VoIP - predictions for uptake and challenges
IP Telephony - economies of scale for new carriers? implications for margins
of incumbents?
Access technologies - what is happening in the IP local loop
How softswitching is going to impact costs and its real advantages
Billing - IP Interconnect and implications for service provisioning
Costs of OSS and business support systems
What enterprise case studies you would like to hear about and what industry
sectors are the most relevant to you?
The delegate profile for the event will be CEOs, CFOs, Strategy & Planning
Directors, International Network Directors, Sales Directors, Marketing
Directors, Business Development Directors, CTOs, IT Directors, Network
Architects and MDs of the following markets -
IP Carriers
ISPs
Bandwidth Exchanges
Optical networking equipment vendors
Consultants
Systems integrators
Billing vendors
OSS suppliers
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the above topics with you and any
other topics you may feel should be included in the programme. If you would
like to hear from particular speakers also, please let me know and I will
endeavour to invite them to participate. There are speaking opportunities on
the programme as it is very much in its nascent stages and when I have a
draft programme written I would like to discuss participation with you.
I look forward to hearing from you soon as I am on a tight deadline as
always and ideally would like to speak to you for a short time sometime this
week.
Kind regards
Noreen Meehan

NYMEX sees private placement before IPO.
NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The New York Mercantile Exchange, which this 
month converted to a for-profit company, is aiming to sell shares to the 
public within nine months of a private placement to strategic investors, 
NYMEX Chairman Daniel Rappaport said Monday.  But no part of the world's 
largest physical commodity exchange will be up for sale until after the 
launch of its delayed eNYMEX electronic trading platform, now targeted for 
early May, Rappaport told Reuters in a telephone interview.  ""I'd say three 
to nine months (after the private placement) depending on market conditions 
and eNYMEX traction,"" Rappaport said, referring to the initial public 
offering (IPO). NYMEX faces intense competitive challenges to overhaul itself 
and modernize for the 21st century.  The reorganizing London Metal Exchange 
(LME) voted in September to demutalize and is introducing screen trading 
while the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) went wholly 
to electronic trading on Monday, waving goodbye to the shouts and hand 
signals of traditional open outcry trade.  NYMEX demutualized 10 days ago, 
changing its not-for-profit membership structure into that of a 
profit-seeking corporation and renaming itself New York Mercantile Exchange 
Inc.  No IPO can occur until shareholders vote to decouple their stakes from 
the seats which give them rights to trade futures in crude oil, natural gas, 
electricity, heating oil and gasoline on the floor. Rappaport said that 
NYMEX's investment bankers advised a private placement first, in part because 
of recent stock market jitters, and to capitalize on the 128-year-old 
exchange's unique story and build credibility for a market offering. The 
NYMEX said no decisions have been made yet as to how much to sell privately. 
But plenty of potential investors have queued up. Among others, NYMEX has 
open arms toward partners in Intercontinental Exchange, an Internet-based 
trading competitor which NYMEX declined to join when Intercontinental was 
launched earlier this year, deciding then on the solo route. ""The deal that 
was offered was then, and still today looking back on it, was unacceptable,"" 
he said. ""That is not to say that some of partners in the Intercontinental 
Exchange would not also be attractive partners to us today. ""We would very 
much like to have some of them join in and invest in the exchange. And I will 
tell you that a lot of them have expressed very strong interest."" 
Intercontinental Exchange this summer started over-the-counter trade in gold 
and silver and plans to open up Web-based dealing in energy products in the 
fourth quarter. Backing it are some of the world's top oil companies and 
banks, including BP Amoco Plc. , Royal Dutch/Shell Group Goldman Sachs and 
Deutsche Bank AG . Rappaport said the unfriendly market environment for 
listing shares was a ""double edged sword"" for NYMEX. ""The fact that dot-coms, 
and e-commerce in general, don't have the momentum that they had six months 
ago is not good for us in terms of doing an IPO that has e-commerce as a 
material part of its valuation,"" he said. But he said no competitor was 
better positioned than NYMEX. NYMEX has linked up with Platts, a division of 
publishers McGraw-Hill, for pricing on eNYMEX contracts and with software 
applications company Kiodex Inc. to provide a trade engine for the order 
matching system. But these have no equity stakes. Rappaport said any desire 
to team up with big market partners who might give eNYMEX some critical mass 
was balanced against NYMEX's condition that it maintain market neutrality. 
""We cannot be perceived as being dominated by any company or small group of 
companies,"" he said. ""Having market neutrality will be critical to any 
platform's long-term success."" Rappaport said delays in eNYMEX, which was 
first to start in the third quarter this year, was not now placing it at a 
disadvantage against up-and-running over-the-counter platforms like 
Intercontinental, which could yet be its main worry. ""If Intercontinental 
launches and clears futures than we're talking about a whole different 
competitive landscape,"" he said. ""The fact that Intercontinental has put 
together such a powerful group of industrial players really forces us to view 
them as a formidable competitive threat should they chose to go down that 
road."" NYMEX will begin e-trade with energy futures, leaving to a later date 
gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper and aluminum in part because it has 
yet to iron out a dispute with members of NYMEX's COMEX metals division over 
the right to trade those electronically during New York hours. ""We believe we 
can establish terms that are equitable to the individual COMEX member's 
interests and to the exchange's interests,"" he said. ""But to the extent that 
we can't, I don't view that has having any significant impact on either the 
private placement or the IPO or the valuation issue."" For now, Rappaport does 
not envision his floor veterans herding dinosaur-like behind LIFFE traders 
out the door. ""The challenge for the U.S. exchanges, those that have a 
history in open outcry is to wrap the open outcry market in technology in a 
way that permits them to compete with electronic marketplaces. ""I see it 
almost an electronic trading system with human intervention at some point in 
the liquidity chain, for certain products. We've already gone wholly 
electronic in electricity.""

Feds Hint at Power Bill Refunds 
Firms ordered to justify high rates 
David Lazarus and Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers
Saturday, March 10, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N144141.DTL 
Federal regulators warned power companies yesterday that they may have to 
refund $69 million to California ratepayers for charging unreasonable prices 
during recent electricity shortages. 
However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission left the door wide open for 
the unnamed 13 generators to avoid refund payments if they could offer 
""further justification"" for why their rates should be considered fair. 
Consumer activists were quick to note that the commission's order was 
significant. 
""They have acknowledged for the first time that there has been abuse of the 
marketplace,"" said Doug Heller, assistant organizing director for the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""It's an 
acknowledgment that the power companies have been ripping us off."" 
However, consumer groups also pointed out that the order -- issued late in 
the day -- was partly a political ploy intended to make the Bush 
administration look more sympathetic to California's plight. 
The proposed $69 million refund also represents only a fraction of the 
billions of dollars that utilities have had to pay due to rising electricity 
rates. 
The commission set narrow parameters for power charges in January that may be 
considered unreasonable. It is only considering charges above $273 per 
megawatt hour during the series of Stage 3 energy emergencies that threatened 
statewide blackouts. 
William Massey, the lone commissioner who voted against the order, noted that 
of 70,300 power transactions in January above $150 per megawatt hour, only 
about 13,000 fall within the regulatory commission's parameters for potential 
refunds. 
""This order is arbitrary, capricious and unlawful,"" he said. ""Eighty percent 
of the transactions have been excluded from refunds."" 
But commission Chairman Curt Hebert characterized the order as an aggressive 
effort to safeguard California consumers. 
""Today's refund order demonstrates the commission's commitment to ensure 
appropriate and reasonable prices in the wholesale electricity market given 
the supply and demand imbalance in California,"" he said in a statement. 
POWER COMPANIES NOT WORRIED
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
energy-industry association in Menlo Park, said power companies are not 
worried about the prospect of having to pay out millions of dollars in 
refunds. 
""The people I've talked to said they can justify the costs for a majority of 
hours where FERC said there may have been overcharges,"" he said. 
""We will be supplying supporting data to FERC,"" said Richard Wheatley, a 
spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston. ""We commend them for doing this 
review. We believe this can be resolved and we can all move on."" 
Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade 
group representing out-of-state generators, said the commission's order shows 
that the system is working. 
""In my opinion, what has been identified is talking about potential refunds, 
"" he said. ""The generators will have a chance to justify their rates. I'm not 
terribly troubled by that."" 
The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power 
grid, welcomed the order, although it said $69 million is lower than its own 
estimates of potential overcharges. 
The ISO had asked the commission earlier this month to review $350 million in 
January power charges that exceeded the regulatory commission's ""soft cap"" of 
$150 per megawatt hour. 
A soft cap means the price can exceed the prescribed amount as long as a 
supplier can justify the charge. 
REFUND ORDERS ARE RARE
""The granting of refunds by FERC is not a common occurrence,"" said Charles 
Robinson, the ISO's general counsel. ""We're treading new ground."" 
Considering the potential ramifications of the order, the commission was 
oddly furtive in issuing its press release at the very end of the business 
week. 
The commission's press office already was closed by the time of the 
announcement, and the commissioners had left for the day. 
Reached at his home, Massey acknowledged that the commission was all but 
inviting power companies to bury the commission in paperwork to support their 
wholesale rates. 
""Welcome to the Hebert chairmanship,"" he said. 
Hebert was appointed head of the commission last month by President Bush. 
Since then, the regulatory commission and the Bush administration have 
maintained a largely hands-off approach to California's energy crisis. 
""We have said from the beginning that obviously the state of California has 
to address these problems and these challenges,"" U.S. Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham said this week.

EOL users can run eports and see all the details of transactions.  As 
currently structured this would mean that any EOL user, including ENA, would 
be able to run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity.  
Obviously this would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules.  At 
their last meeting Dale and Shelley outlined three possible ways to address 
this:
Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid 
data.  I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically 
difficult or expensive.
Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether.  Here the story 
was that while this was not necessarily difficult, EOL could not make any 
changes before version 2 was ready.  The impression was that this would be 
possible after version 2.
Erect procedural firewalls.  Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could 
inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents 
them from running reports on GPG data.  This probably isn't a good long-run 
solution, but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure.  This 
approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered 
into a confidentiality agreement with GPG.
Solutions 1 and 2 require extensive technical work and unfortunately we 
cannot currently spare the technical resources required for it. We can go 
with solution 3 at present with the understanding that in the absence of a 
large volume of trades it might be the permanent solution. This is something 
that legal on both sides would have to agree to. Steve will check with their 
legal department to see if this is acceptable. Dale can you please check with 
Mark Taylor.
Further the credit departments on both sides should meet and iron out the 
credit issues. Steve is going to make sure the two credit departments talk to 
each other.
Thanks.

Subject: Gallup - Status Update
The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is 
not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The 
engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not 
harmful to the compressor for the short term.
It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to 
vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be 
reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any 
further feedback.
TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the 
vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which 
can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit 
piping. 
EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have 
decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction 
strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage.  
The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It 
is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system.
EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running 
without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running 
intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run 
time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should 
have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed 
with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor.
It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while 
the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the 
reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment 
or apply stress to the compressor nozzles.

Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business
Wednesday, September 6, 2000 12:49 PM	
	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	By James Covert 
	Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading 
rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president 
Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday. 
	""Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation,"" Skilling 
said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the 
power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is ""absolutely 
not"" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said. 
	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired ""peaking plants,"" 
which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices, 
Skilling said. 
	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and 
South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said. 
	""The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe,"" Skilling 
said. ""The market there is more fractional, and that creates more 
opportunities for someone who's playing across the board."" 
	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher 
per-unit rate of return, Skilling said. 
	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in 
building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals 
may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies. 
	""We are not interested in building base-load plants,"" Skilling said, 
referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities 
around the clock. 
	""Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated 
commodity,"" Skilling said. ""But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape 
of the market of that commodity."" 
	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's 
future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone. 
	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there 
are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on 
any one geographic region as opposed to others. 
	""There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000 
megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's 
possible,"" Skilling said. ""There are just too many variables to approach 
markets like that.""

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.
The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-
(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.
I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.
Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.
If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.
Happy New Year
Louise"

I went by some houses last night . . .
This house was by far the nicest and best bang for your buck, but in a 
suspect neighborhood - it looks like they are building a lot of townhouses 
close though
check it out . . .

These were nice too - more contemporary though . . .

Subject: MDEA, Clarksdale and Yazoo City
Body: 
Another research report. Miss. Code Ann Sec 21-27-59 provides that nothing in 
the law pursuant to which CPU was created shall be construed to prohibit the 
municipality from using general revenues to pay the ""immediate expenses of 
operation and/or maintence"" of the system. However, the statute provides that 
nothing requires the municipality to do so either.
We've found no case law expanding on this statute. Thus, there is no clear 
answer whether obligations of CPU to Enron would be considered the kinds of 
expenses which may be paid. If a guarantee by CPU of the obligations of MDEA 
is insufficient,  then it may be worth raising this issue with David Hunt.
As I mentioned in my voicemail last week, I do have some comments on the 
proposed agreement. Please let me know if you wish to discuss."

To:  The Legal Trading Committee
In light of some recent comments of one of our counterparties, we are 
considering amending the Enron Canada Corp. Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale 
Agreement (the ""Master Physical Agreement"") to clarify the events 
constituting  a ""Seller's Deficiency Default"" (see s.6.2) and a ""Buyer's 
Deficiency Default"" (see s.6.4).  We are also considering expanding the 
suspension rights of a ""Notifying Party"" to include the suspension of 
""receipts of Gas"" under s.10.1.  
In this regard, please find attached a draft of an amended Master Physical 
Agreement which has been blacklined to indicate the aforementioned proposed 
changes.  
When you get the opportunity, please let me know if you think these changes 
are suitable/warranted.  I can be reached directly at (403) 974-6708.

Saturday:
Mark from Aquilla was short 5000 into the Valero Hub and it appeared that 
PG&E may have to cut Aquilla's delivery into us, but Mark was able to get the 
5000 he needed to make the delivery.
Transco Bammel had some Unit testing by Transco preventing flow until 9 PM.  
I got with Robert A. From the East desk and he decided to go ahead and cut 
the nom down to 30 for Saturday's gas day.  I changed the confirm in Pops to 
reflect it.
Changed confirm for Midcon Hardy to show the correct 20,000.
Changed the confirm for Flaggstaff to show the correct 0.
Communicated with Reggie from Dynegy to get 4,000 at Transco Markham for 
Saturday's gas day confirmed with Transco.  It was finally confirmed later 
that night.
Sunday
At 6:00 the flow into Valero Riverside was 0'd out and changed to Valero 
T'Ville for the remainder of the gas day.  Gas Control said to do it 
verbally.  I could not get a hold of any scheduler with PG&E to see the 
contractual impact.  I let Ed Gottlob know and he said to just let it flow."

Jeff, 
FYI.  This is an excellent email and one that addresses all the issues we 
need to make decisions on.  Lets discuss because I have some views but am 
very open to others especially when I don't really know (first hand) what 
oppts really look like there.  We need to address quickly.
Mike

Hello Mike, 
I tried to call you several times yesterday but you were busy all the time. 
The reason why I called is that I have some questions that I will like your 
input on before I take a decision. I will try to call you later today but 
here are some of the questions.
You and Jeff talks about a senior position for me. What do you mean by that 
and what will Joe's position be. Will he still be the ""president"" or will he 
take a more active role on the origination side. What will Jeremy's role be. 
Today he does all these senior structuring deals with EGM products.
Focus. There are very many commodities to look at here but since we have 
limited resources at this stage we need some focus in the beginning. If we 
look at everything at once - nothing will happen.
There are two areas that looks ""easy"" to start with. Softs and Liquids. How 
willing are EGM to focus on these in the beginning. The reason for I call 
these areas ""easy"" is that there are big and very liquid liquids and soft 
markets here and it therefore will possible to do transactions early to get 
some momentum in the business. The other markets have large potential but 
will take much longer time to develop. I look at Equity/FX/Interest as 
something Darren will continue focus on.
When some of these markets start to develop and we will have some marketing 
activities/trading going on where will the books probably be and to whom will 
we report. If we do Softs will it be to Gary or will it be to Jeff. How will 
it be integrated. I have no problem with say reporting liquids etc to John 
Nowlan, Softs to Gary, weather to Mark. I think this will be a good solution 
because it will force them to follow us up and it will be easier to 
communicate strategies back and forth etc. The situation today on weather is 
something that I do not like. We have the book, but we do not have any real 
support from Houston or real responsibility. If that is the situation we will 
soon have a lot of problems. It is not a secret within Enron that the 
Singapore oil situation, coal in Asia/Australia and the weather in 
Scandinavia/Europe are not optimal. For me to take a decision I will need to 
know that there are support and willingness from all the heads of EGMs 
different commodities for developing the possibilities in this region, not 
only from you and Jeff. I do not want to use all my time fighting internal 
battles, but I know that it will be hard work to make a business grow.
Staff. In my power trading group today I have 2 managers and 9 AAs. The 
managers + 2 Asso are what I call marketing guys and the rest are analysts 
(some with trading potential). We have no one with trading background in EGM 
products so that need to be recruited. At the same time many of these AAs 
have started within the last 6 months so they are not fully Enronized so it 
would be a good idea to send over some AAs or managers to teach people models 
etc. 
You mentioned Singapore in the TC, what will happen with them?
How does EGM reward people for starting up businesses. It was almost 
impossible to get someone to help me building up the power here (both London 
and Houston). People, especially not traders, do not want to leave a 
profitable book or origination activities. Quite many got the feedback in 
last PRC that they need a number to their name, both P&L and number of 
originated deals, so they did not dare to leave. How will that be handled 
here?
I think my main strength is trading, and I prefer to do trading, but I have 
quite good origination skills. Iknow that in a start up process you need to 
do both and I am more than willing to do that. 
This was a lot of questions but to get some feedback on them are necessary 
for me to take a decision. I will probably go to London on Wednesday and 
Thursday next week to speak with Sherriff etc. I will try to call you later 
today
Regards
Morten Erik"
