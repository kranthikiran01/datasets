Hi Louise,
Are you in agreement with these charges, and which team should I apply them to (trading teams vs OOC)?

Hi Edie!
I have attached two files that I received from Andrew Parsons for Enron America's headcount on the contingency floor. Per Andrew, he discussed this project, (which will provide traders with an alternative workspace should the need arise), with Louise Kitchen.  This expense project is being carried on Net Works books and will be allocated out to the business units using project settlement rules in the Project System module of SAP. This project will cover the period September  through December, 2001 and should cost approximately  $ 750K in total .  I will need a cost center or account or project, etc. to charge Enron America's share ( .270 for power and .402 for gas) of the costs.
Thank you for your prompt attention!

Shona - 
I just wanted to make sure you knew what a great job Chris does as a liason 
between your group and Market Risk Management on all the DPR and limit 
issues.  He is extremely responsive to our (MRM) inquiries and requests for 
information, and has been instrumental in helping me gather information and 
understand the DPR reporting process so that I can prepare better and more 
meaninful analyses for the BOD and for Rick Buy.  And he's been a pleasure to 
work with throughout all the changes to the notification process, and appears 
willing to embrace suggestions on how to improve risk reporting processes 
further.
Your entire group's teamwork and work ethic has enabled me to add value in my 
new position here, and while I got the opportunity to express this via PEP 
for you and Eugenio, I didn't do a review on Chris, so I wanted to make sure 
you knew.

Rough Takeoff for Orbitz
By now you've probably heard about Orbitz, the airline-owned travel
Web site that launched Monday to much fanfare. But after most of the
hype disappeared, opinions differed on whether the site would ever
earn its wings.
Most recently, Thursday's Wall Street Journal ran an article about the
problems Orbitz had in its first few days off the ground. A
fiber-optic cable was severed in Orbitz's home city of Chicago,
slowing response times for three hours. Call centers in Florida were
swamped. Then Orbitz took the site down for an upgrade early Wednesday
and neglected to put up a placeholder. And this is after Orbitz
delayed its launch by 10 months ""to perfect its service and product
offering,"" the Journal wrote.
Washington Post columnist Keith Alexander tested a few sample routes,
and Orbitz competitor Travelocity found the cheapest fare two times
out of three. WebTravelNews.com reported that the investment bank
Pacific Crest did a more formal pricing audit and ""found that Orbitz
ranked last compared to Expedia and Travelocity when it came to
price."" Orbitz seems to prefer the results from Arthur Andersen's
study, which said Orbitz meets or beats its competitors' low fares in
more than four out of five instances.
The Associated Press took Orbitz down another peg when it observed
that ""Orbitz is not the first online travel site to offer consumers
the special fares airlines once sold only on their own Web sites."" A
California company called SideStep has done something similar since
November. The Post agreed that Orbitz is ""not an original concept.""
Even Manitowoc, Wisconsin's Herald Times Reporter dismissed Orbitz,
albeit from a bricks-and-mortar angle. ""The launch of the new Orbitz
Web site by five major airlines probably won't have a major impact on
travel agencies,"" said the article. The owner of the local business
David's House of Travel wasn't worried, since she assumed Orbitz would
split existing Internet customers with Travelocity and Expedia.
Happily for Orbitz, Reuters cut the company some slack in an article
that took its cue from an Orbitz press release. Because of the chaos
the Journal wrote about, Orbitz vowed to double its call-center staff
to more than 200 people over the next few weeks. ""Having a lot of
business is a good problem to have,"" said an Orbitz spokesperson,
keeping the hype alive. - Jen Muehlbauer

VoterApathy.Co.Uk
Thought you could escape more Internet politics until 2004? Not if
you're reading the British media. England voted for prime minister on
Thursday, and the digital gimmickry involved may be more interesting
than Tony Blair's probable win.
The most brazen high-tech pitches have been the Labour Party's text
messages to about 5,000 mobile phone users. They range from the overly
cute (""thursday. It's a date then! X Labour on jun 7"") to the vaguely
issue-oriented (one that the Guardian's Textmessage-ese-to-English
dictionary translates as ""20-billion-pound cuts or extra money for
schools and hospitals - you decide on Thursday""). Both the Guardian
and the Times seized on the cryptic ""d:*O WUCIWUG #:-O VTE LBR 2MORO""
- supposedly the first four characters represent Conservative
candidate William Hague in a baseball cap. Silly, but Labour seems
willing to try anything to woo the 80 percent of under-25s who don't
intend to vote. Labour hopes the recipients will forward the messages
to their friends. Media Grok hopes to win the lottery.
The Register offered a different solution for voter apathy: Go to
4noneoftheabove.com and register your displeasure with the candidates.
That site may make as much of a difference in the election as the
candidates' and parties' official sites.
""Attempts by the political parties to address voters directly through
official Web sites look set to be judged a flop,"" said the Financial
Times. ""The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour all paid out
handsomely to develop Web sites, but the real high-tech battle is
raging over the nation's phones, e-mails and television sets."" It's
not much of a battle if you believe the Democracy Online Project's
Michael Cornfield, who told the BBC, ""What the Internet does not do is
convince undecided people to go one way or another.""
If you can stand any more talk about this subject - in other words,
our British readers are excused now - there are plenty of
philosophical pieces on the nature of digital politics. The Guardian's
Mike Anderiesz and S.A. Mathieson pondered the effect online voting
could have on politics, while the BBC rehashed the effect the Internet
has had on U.S. elections. (McCain had the technology, but Bush still
won the primary).
FT.com has a ""Cyber election"" package that has followed Britain's
e-politicking antics since early May. We particularly like the one
about spoof sites such as Toryparty.co.uk, which once declared,
""Hague's election pledge: free petrol for all."" Even better, The
Register reported the happy coincidence that WilliamHague.com is the
homepage of a nudist from Surrey. - Jen Muehlbauer

Excite's Cyber-Crusade Fizzles
So the Internet isn't exactly Omaha Beach. On the anniversary of the
Allied invasion of Europe, ExciteAtHome fessed up that its
techno-liberation plans on the Continent were kaput. The only surprise
to most outlets was, what took it so long?
According to reporters, Excite is saying adieu, auf wiedersehn and
adios to its operations in France, Germany and Spain, and it will
close another half dozen Euro portals. It's also axing 85 jobs. Excite
blamed the closings on - what else? - the decline in online
advertising. It was reported to have been shopping itself around since
April.
The Register reminded readers that just two months ago, the Euro
division's managing director told the Financial Times that the company
""would rather sell the business for $1 than withdraw from Europe after
all the time and money we have invested."" Before you rustle around
your pocket for the change, Reuters and the Associated Press noted
that the closings came just one day after Excite said it was in talks
about restructuring its commercial relationship with Comcast and Cox
Communications. That's Internet time for you.
The London Times tipped its hat to Excite as one of the best-known Net
brands in Europe, but one analyst told the Wall Street Journal that
the Euro Net scene had been ""waiting to see some of the also-ran
portals close up shop."" Looks like Excite was one of them: It led in
no markets, according to stats the Journal quoted from Jupiter
Communications.
Excite said that for now, its portals in Italy and the U.K. will
remain open. Yeah, yeah, toe-tapped the Register. ""For how long?"" The
skeptical Guardian pegged the sites as intact ""for the time being.""
Crusades just ain't what they used to be. - Deborah Asbrand

Jeffrey's/Josephine sounds excellent.  I could go for the decorating
thing--that would be fun for me....I still think somethign like a limo is in
order.  It may not be our personalities but I think Mother likes a big
to-do.

okay - I would advise this though:  Since we may all be spending $$ on a
trip on Nov. as well, I think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
June.   I don't think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I'll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.
I tell you what might be nice:   Jeffrey's has a private dining area (think
called Josephine's house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -
and Sally had some Enron doo there - I think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice.   -c.

Body: 
So do you know where the piece of the contract came from?  Maybe we can track 
down the rest.  I have seen an electronic copy of a contract which may or may 
not be the correct one since the delivery date is last June.  I think ENA 
needs a complete copy of the contract, including any executed change orders.  
Do you think someone in your group might have that?
Many thanks,

I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just 
to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless 
we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, 
no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade 
European physical power products.  They have licensing requirements similar 
to our FERC licensing.
Thanks!"

Raymond can we discuss. 
(a) This is definitely a possibility. We could back the trade out to EAF 
through an ISDA Agreement we have with RMT (an Enron company based in 
Houston).  
(b) This is also an alternative from an Australian regulatory perspective. 
(c)  Conceptually no reason why not except EAF  has no underlying ISDA 
Agreement with SG USA. Also I suspect this would be less tax effective than 
either one or two. 
(d) Another alternative - We have an ISDA Agreement between EAF and SG 
Australia Ltd . Could these entities be the contracting parties?
Raymond it is really a tax call as to which is the most effective contracting 
structure. I have copies in Susan Musch (our Houston based tax expert). Susan 
have you any ideas. I suspect also there will be some Enron management 
determinations as to the identity of the Enron entity entering into the 
trade. 
One other point Raymond if ENA is the contracting party it really is outside 
my jurisdiction. I would request  Sara Stackleton (who recently assumed took 
overe from Shari Shackleton) assist.

Dear David,
We are about to do a weather trade with SocGen or Aquila on Melbourne 
temperature
Expected trade date is Thursday - 13 April.
Steven Vu, Head Weather trader in Houston will transact with above thru a 
broker in US.
Premium approx 700k AUD.
What is the best way in terms of regulations and tax - assume limits in place 
!
Houston is to take a  portion of the deal too.
(a) ENA trades with SG USA, then back to back transact between ENA & En Aust ?
(b) ENA trades with SG USA, then gives p&L to  En Aust ?
can this P&L be real income or shadow only ?
(c) En Aust trades with SG Usa ( thru Oz arm of US broker or thru US broker)
or any other suggestions ???
Pls revert :o)
Thx,  Raymond

Brenda,
Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.
We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  
The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brenda,
Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.
We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as ""Auditee Responses"", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.
Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response
Rick and Fred:
I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.
1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the ""New Technology Contract"" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under ""special contracts"" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.
These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,
Matthew

Forwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft=
 a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols =
by the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the =
OOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pa=
y an OOME price component when the plant's output is utilized by ERCOT.  Th=
e OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs u=
nder Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensa=
tion has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for =
OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Ra=
te value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOM=
C/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus runn=
ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the =
marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is locat=
ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS=
E to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas=
. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh=
ould be Reliability Must Run (""RMR"") and be paid at an adequate premium for=
 their support of the system' reliability.
I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over =
the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, =
and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinit=
iating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom=
orrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus =
we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with a=
n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): ""thr=
eat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise=
 is not in compliance with these Protocols"".  Though the Protocols Sections=
 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service pr=
oducts that it is 'generating capacity available but not energy delivered t=
o the grid', I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Gui=
des' definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Secti=
on 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinc=
tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi=

Subject:=09Ercot Questions
David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:
Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, s=
tarting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi=
ds exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium =
is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formu=
la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is =
zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An=
 announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o=
ut this week,  per Mark Patterson.
The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actua=
l energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from =
a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the p=
rotocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services=
 with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the s=
pirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.
  =20
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols=
 to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=
atchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were=
 not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=
ns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =
for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=
cot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=
un by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=
c, as we were previously under OOMC orders.
I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=
is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=
cot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at=
 their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=
c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =
for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=
d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark=
 also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=
ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,=
  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=
st money.""
Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =
Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =
a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=
ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =
imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=
ement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=
pes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.
I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment=
"" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comme=
nt.""
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=
sure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same=
 path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =
receive.
I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=
e to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=
rcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =
to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=
w was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =
Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=
ance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=
ployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=
e issue, not a protocol issue.  =20
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=
led.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full=
 load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =

Andrew  Parsons is currently leading a project to define and quantify the 
costs for several different alternatives for disaster recovery.  We should 
get an update from him to see if there is anything applicable.   There is 
sheer disaster that impacts many companies/locations (which may require one 
approach), and then there is nusance stuff (frozen freeways in Houston, etc.) 
that really requires an updated contact list and set of notification 
procedures.  And then there is system failure and the requisite back up.

This topic came up at last week's technical meeting.  Several of the

offer a system even more robust than EOL.  In a related area, we began to

Subject: Disaster Recovery / Business Resumption for Commodity Logic
One of the calculated risks ENA has lived with is the potential 
unavailability of systems given a disaster strikes the Houston area such as a 
hurricane that knocks out power, etc.
Have you given any thought on the commodity logic side of providing a 
hot-backup / fail-over capability from another location ?  This could be 
particularly critical with the Contract Exchange module and might be one 
assurance customers would want before signing up.
For that matter, is there a market in providing disaster recovery / 
hot-backup capability to companies in high-risk areas?  It has traditionally 
been thought of as too expensive to warrant implementing such a capability 
for our own purposes.  Perhaps there are economies of scale that can be 
recognized when providing this capability for many."

Sempra Could Be Takeover Candidate, Newspaper Says
 
The London Telegraph newspaper quoted an analyst who said that U.K.-based 
Centrica could 
be eyeing Sempra Energy as a possible takeover candidate following Centrica's 
purchase of 
Canadian gas and electricity supplier Direct Energy. 
Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity 
belongs to Sempra. 
The newspaper quoted Simon Hawkins, an analyst with UBS Warburg, as saying 
the Direct Energy 
acquisition is ""step one of something much bigger."" In principle, he said, 
there is no reason why 
Centrica shouldn't go after Sempra. Centrica told the newspaper it was 
""talking to Sempra about 
the way forward."" "

Dear Vince,
Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working 
there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? 
Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening 
of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for 
John Martin's ""new economy"" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel 
accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my 
secretary arrange accommodations for you.
Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to 
arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk 
management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this 
spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 
3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have 
you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend 
either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 
1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or 
spring break: 
Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1
Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break)
Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate 
methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of 
Massachusetts
Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2
Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to 
schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be 
scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically 
possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from 
Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from 
Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 
a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.
Thanks again,
Jim

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two
days in a row).
I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the 
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker & 
McKenzie, Tokyo.  Mark Taylor is reviewing the drafts prior to presenting 
them to the potential counterparties.
I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a 
party.  I note that I have copied Jonathan Whitehead on this correspondence, 
as he may be able to provide insight regarding plans for entering into such 
arrangements.

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we

I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange 
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.
Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading 
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in 
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?  
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what 
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other 
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?
If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct 
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?
Sincerely,
Darren

Body: 
Hey guys,
The meeting today will be at 4:30 in EB751.  EES is fine with accepting the 
gas in storage - with no fallback position.  This is largely due to the fact 
that we are in the middle.  We are accepting the gas in storage, so EES 
really has no choice.  However, they are starting to show some concern for 
swing and true-up volumes.  My thought at this point is that since they are 
receiving the gas in storage, there is no need to worry about swing - it can 
fit in the storage with the rest of the gas.  This may cost something, but it 
should not cost as much as a put.
EES also wants daily as opposed to first of the month delivery.  That's about 
it.  See you at 4:30.
Andrew"

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  
I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  
Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty
Sally,
I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 
What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?
It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.
 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 
Debbie"

Alberto,
You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.
Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.
Kevin"

Subject:  CAEM Board of Directors Meeting
The next meeting of the CAEM Board of Directors will be held on Wednesday,
September 12, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, DC.
The meeting is being held in conjunction with the third meeting of our DISCO
of the Future Forum. (Please visit our newly updated website www.caem.org
for more information on the DISCO Forum.) Following the Board meeting on
Wednesday, you are invited to join with members of the DISCO Forum for a
Wednesday evening reception and dinner, including a guest speaker. Board
members are also invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO
Forum on Thursday, September 13.
Because of an international medical convention ongoing in Washington at the
same time as our meetings, the Grand Hyatt unfortunately is already booked.
However, we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel. To
reserve one of these rooms, you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are
part of the CAEM group. If you should decide to arrange lodging at a
different hotel, please do so quickly as there is limited availability in
all surrounding hotels. We will be making the Wyndham rooms available to
members of the DISCO Forum on July 20.
If you have any questions or require any assistance at all, please contact
Hope Duncan at 202.739.0134 or Jeff Mangold at 703.729.2710. We are looking
forward to seeing you on September 12.

Subject: New real options presentation
All
Attached in the latest version of my real options presentation, which I'll be 
presenting at a Real Options Group conference in Cambridge next month.
I've removed the gas storage pricing example, and instead put in a simple 
example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches (should 
one wish to do so).  This is a response to the heavily decision-tree 
dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at.  I 
want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and 
option pricing as special cases, the synthesis needed for correct real option 
valuation.
My presentation now covers:
1. Decision trees.
2. Binomial option pricing trees.
3. Power station valuation.
4. Power asset development.
The option pricing and power examples are based on the (too simplistic) 
binomial tree method.  I obviously won't indicate my thoughts on the most 
correct way to do this.

Thanks for the information.  I need to take a closer look at Janet's 
language, particularly the ""null and void"" language to make sure that it 
covers all possible events of default under the Master Agreement.  As to the 
Texas law issue, our ability to get comfortable from a legal standpoint will 
in large part be dictated by this issue.  Is there anyway to get more 
certainty on this with the sureties?  I understand that you don't want to go 
to them multiple times but this is a key issue for us.  Let me know what you 
think.

In my opinion, the wording suggested by Janet Green should be acceptable.
We
will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies
prior
to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all
questions
have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds
being
subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will
address
that with the sureties along with other potential changes.
In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that
would
be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the
Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do
with
the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the
State of
New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.  MJH

What if we said:  ""if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
obligation shall be null and void""
With respect to her second point, what if we again said ""an Event of
Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
the Master Agreement""?
I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?
Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that ""if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void,"" does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, ""an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement"" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?
I look forward to hearing from you.

In Clay-speak,   she is a top quality ""all around athlete.""  Ken called me 
this morning to tell me that Cindy had expressed a high interest and capacity 
to work for you in the transition.    I know you are getting many calls of 
this sort,  but this is one you may want to look at.   She's attractive,  
articulate,  experienced,   a great team player,  energetic and a focused 
worker.  She might make someone a terrific #1 although she is capable or 
working at a high level without adult supervision.
Ken is going to send her resume to me,   and indicated that he planned to

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
""Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,"" said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. ""There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online."" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. ""In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow ""will be on a leave of absence from the company."" He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that ""management does care"" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as ""an admissi=
on of guilt."" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible ""death spiral"" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with ""trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust,"" he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS
10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company
The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a ""leave of absence"" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO,"" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a ""Chinese wall"" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an ""=
informal inquiry"" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=
, moved from a ""hold"" to a ""sell"" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO,"" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. ""We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know,"" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=

To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=

ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=

The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=

Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)
     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.
     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.
     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''
     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''
     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''
     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''
     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''
     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''
     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''
     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''
     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''
     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''
     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''
     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
""It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC,"" Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. ""W=
ho knows?""
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO,"" Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
""I think change is good at this particular point in time,"" said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. ""I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered.""=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
""I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,"" Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
""There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community,"" Heim said. ""Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever.""=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
""The market was asking for that to happen,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. ""This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis.""=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been ""cautious and defensive in their app=
roach,"" he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
""I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges,"" Heim said. ""What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed.""=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
""It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now,"" he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
""Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships),"" Feygin said. ""Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do.""

ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO,"" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to ""sell"" from ""hold."" Ms. Coale said the rating change is ""not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=

Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=

Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the ""Fastow era"" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it cr=

Heya.  Hope things are good.  How are you looking with the buyout?  I
haven't heard any screams from Midtown so I'll take that as a good sign.
Thought this might put a smile on your face.

with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned
by
the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to
your
listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with
an

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 
Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.
Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan
Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

The below email is in regards to the cost charts Sheri asked that I provide to Greg Piper.  The comment, ""The goal for us is to put the information into a form that I can share with potential external counterparties on Tuesday"" is why I am forwarding the email to you.  I will dig deeper to understand the purpose.  Also, Sally the gas chart is for both Financial and Physical and the increase in cost for February is due to social security and unemployment taxes.  These cost were incorrectly recorded to our cost centers and will be reversed during March.

Hi Sheri --
I hope your Mom's surgery went fine.
Thanks for pulling the info together.  I have meetings on Monday until 3pm, but I believe that David can get together with you on Monday morning.  Perhaps David can pull in someone else from our team also.  The goal for us is to put the information into a form that I can share with potential external counterparties on Tuesday.  Thanks again for your help.

		Dear Mike,
		
		Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford is back in Washington, D.C. today.  He 
says next week will be a whirlwind with the unveiling of the White House 
Energy Task Force's National Energy Policy recommendations. President Bush 
will be in St. Paul, Minnesota on Thursday announcing the recommendations, 
and D.C. bureau's Peter Cook is getting ready to cover the event.  Peter will 
bring us reports next week. 
		
		Also from Washington, D.C. next week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee is holding a much-anticipated confirmation hearing for the two 
newest FERC nominees.  If the committee clears Pat Wood and Nora Mead 
Brownell, the full Senate could consider the nominations soon after.  We'll 
have more information on the hearing next week.   
		
		Houston bureau's Kim Benestante tells us the Panda Corporation is bringing a  
1,000-megawatt power plant online in June in Odessa, TX.  The new plant will 
accompany their Guadalupe County plant near San Antonio that's already 
online.  Kim says she'll also bring us details on a Los Angeles investor that 
is buying majority interest in Plains Pipeline.  Log on all next week for 
stories from ENL's Houston bureau.    
		
		Also next week, Houston bureau's Gale Smith is in Anchorage, Alaska covering 
the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  We'll bring 
you reports from Gale in Alaska next week. 
		
		We have plenty more energy news coming up on ENL.  On Monday from our D.C. 
bureau, Editor of Downstream Energy Group Carol Cole is scheduled to join 
us.  She'll be live in D.C. to discuss the fallout from the Valero-Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock merger.  You can catch Cole's comments in the 4:00 p.m. ET 
broadcast.  
		
		In the 9:00 a.m. ET broadcast on Wednesday, President and COO of Unit 
Corporation John Nikkel is scheduled to be in studio to discuss drilling.  
Log on all week to catch these and other interviews.   
		
		Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally 
guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep 
you updated on future interviews and events.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.
1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.
2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.

John"

Greg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.  My only comments would be 
(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the 
commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual 
matter.  I agree about Tana.

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process
Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.
In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.
With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.
Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.
If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.
Thanks
Greg"

Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day 
deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John 
about this?  I am supportive of this proposal and approach.  Like our 
discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of 
this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.  We also 
have to support Lay's efforts in California.

Dave,
I just spoke with Freeman to let him know that we can provide him a letter 
proposal which I can send out Monday.  In general, we will offer 50MW NP-15 
Peak from February 22 - March 31 at a fixed price (currently $265) with 
payment due every 7 days.  This would be documented under the form of EEI 
that they have agreed to and is subject to (i) payment of outstanding amounts 
due Enron; (ii) execution of EEI and confirm; (iii) confirmation that they 
will pay the amounts due; (iv) good faith obligation to put together 
creidtworthy structure; (v) good faith look at term deal which can be 
back-dated to blend with this current deal, Pastoria and Demand Management.  
It took some time to nail down the settlement numbers on our side.  Legal 
spent some time with Freeman's attorney but got agreement on the EEI Form.  
Credit likes this a lot.    Tim will have Lavo wear the market exposure - 
$2MM if the market falls $100.  David Freeman said he would look at it Monday 
but it sounded good.  
I will pull it together and copy you over the weekend.

Normally we inactivate old deals on the first Sunday of the month that lies 
closest to the 10th.
The job takes a long time and is run over the weekend. This Sunday (the 8th) 
we will inactivate
all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so 
that performance
(speed & stability) can be enhanced. The only application that this really 
affects is Position Manager.
Our IT department has asked if they can do this for all the April deals on 
May 6th next month.
Any concerns, please call the Sitara Hotline 853-7049
Thanks

Godfrey,
The final actualizations for Preliminary and Final Settlements are available and can be found in the following Flash file:
M:\Electric\CALISO ACTUALIZATION\Actual\2000\Final\0900 Settlements Final ISO 042701.xls
The following customers have been paid an initial amount, and are owed the additional amount as shown:
You will note that Snohomish was overpaid, and owes us a refund in the amount of $1,591.06; the remaining amounts are balances owed to the customer.   I can find no record of an initial payment to El Paso (EPE), but the Flash report reflects a payment owed to them.  Other customers reflected in the Flash are handled in a different manner and we need to talk about those (CRC, DELANO, HARBOR, Willamette, etc.).  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions about this data, or the details in the Flash file, as well as to discuss the special-handling customers.
Please set up these payments to go out as quickly as possible, and let me know the expected payment date.
Thanks,
Caroline

 Markets, and 31 January 2002 Day-Ahead Market
The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 10:00, 17:00, and 23:00 in the
January 30, 2002 Real-Time Market.
Prices in the January 31, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.
Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

With regard to your open season testimony, I would remove the last paragraph
(noted below) on market concentration
""As noted above, the concentration limit applies only in the primary market.
There are currently no controls in these rules against market concentration in
the secondary market.  While the unconstricted nature of the secondary market
will facilitate more and new entrants in the capacity market, this fluid 
quality
nevertheless creates a risk of concentration, insofar as capacity that was
awarded in the initial Open Season may be assigned to any creditworthy market
participant and without market share limits.  Indeed, the Comprehensive
Settlement does not provide for a mandatory electronic bulletin board for
secondary market trades and, accordingly, tracking secondary market trades 
would
be complicated and administratively infeasible.  Nonetheless, the Commission
should remain cognizant of the risk of market concentration and commit to
respond to any such complaints raised by market participants.""
With all due respect, it is a rather transparent attempt to get the Commission
to focus on on the secondary market issue. We agreed to exclude secondary 
market
acquisitions as a measure of market concentration. The above paragraph signals
the Commission that this is a problem and dilutes the value of the testimony."

Subject: DWR Stranded Cost Update
Body: 
Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.
In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.
The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.
As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Curtis,
The TAGG IQ report we run daily compares our positions to our limits per the 
NYMEX.  It is imperative that this report is accurate at all times.  There is 
a significant amount of risk associated with violating our NYMEX limits, 
including disallowing Enron to trade futures.  This would be a very serious 
problem.   Our legal department receives this report daily to ensure we are 
complying with our limits.  
Please let me know what I need to do to get a resource to review the problem 
we are having.   Your proposed alternative solution will not work on a daily 
basis.  The TAGG IQ report includes many other commodities besides natural 
gas.  Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
Mike

The problem with your port calc's is there is no April futures price being 
loaded.  Speak with Veronica Arriaga about that.  The other is there is no 
Volatility curve loaded for NBSK.  Speak to Robert Richard about that.
The report is probably not accurate.  It was written long ago and we just do 
not have the resources at the moment to look at it.  The much better solution 
is to run an ERMS report that you have used in the past.  Dutch Quigley will 
be able to help you with that.  Dutch will only be able to help you with 
Natural Gas, if there are other commodities in question let me know.

I need some help in the following areas. Do you think you could help me?
First, the following post ids for TAGG/METACALC Metaid #10472 are always 
erroring out. It doesn't matter what time of the day I run it. They are as 
follows:
622013
622012
576271
247701
216939
216946
Any information you could provide would be appreciated.
Secondly, I am not too sure that the TAGG IQ report that I send to Mark 
Taylor in Legal is working properly. I have no way of telling, however from 
my side. Do you know at all? Is this something you can advise? The report is 
under Report Group: Exchange Controls. The The Report name is Limits.IQR. The 
numbers are not changing from day-to-day. I would appreciate it if you could 
look into this.
Thanks for your time,

Jeff -
As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:
?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.
Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Importance:	High
To confirm my conversation with Joel just now.
We have been speaking to Michael Brown about giving the representation contained in Clause 4.1(f) of the West LB Facility Agreement relating to material litigation, accompanied with a general disclosure letter.  
Given our distance from the SEC inquiries and other potential litigation, we are not in position to confirm whether or not such litigation has a reasonable possibility of success and/or the effects an adverse decision might have on Enron Corp's business and, more importantly, consolidated financial position or consolidated results.
Accordingly, we cannot give this representation here in Europe and thus cannot issue LC Requests under the West LB facility until we receive a short, written confirmation from (i) a senior Enron Corp officer, for example, Jeff or Ben and (ii) a senior Enron Corp lawyer, eg, Mark Haedicke or Jordan, that, as a factual matter, Enron Corp is not as of today in breach of the representation contained in Clause 4.1(f) and thus we can issue ""clean"" LC Request Forms, without a qualification to this representation (but with, if necessary, a disclosure letter about the SEC inquiry and other litigation).  
We have also been asked by West LB to explain why yesterday we issued the LC Request form attaching Schedule A, ie, stating that we could not give the Clause 4.1(f) representation and today or tomorrow we intend to issue an LC Request without such qualification to Clause 4.1(f).  I should be grateful if you would draft this letter or let me know the circumstances behind the issuance of the original LC Request yesterday.
Please call Marcus or me if you want to discuss this further.  My direct line is +44 207 783 2403 and mobile is +44 7785 295876.
Kind regards

Subject:	New Factor Loadings Have Been Run
All -
New factor loadings were run today (effective date 16-October-2001).
Attached is the VaR file which demonstrates the effect on VaR utilizing 16-October positions/prices/vols.
You may check the before and after factor loadings using the web link (test website) at:	http://rac.dev.corp.enron.com/rmc/MarketRiskApps.asp
Factor loading definition IDs are 2068 for the current factor and 2108 for the new one.
You may check correlations using RisktRAC's Data Grabber.
Correlation definition IDs are 1780 for the current factor and 1800 for the new one.
Implementation:	David has expressed his desire that analysis and the decision whether to implement factor loadings be completed within 24 hours; in other words by end of day Thursday.  If a decision is made not to implement, analysis should be provided indicating the reason (rather than ""need more time"").
Contact:		Frank Hayden in Houston at x58341 (or E-Mail him) as I will be out of the office tomorrow and Friday

These meetings that were set up with Pawar in Delhi were supposed to be 
attended by Wade but but he was unable to attend them due to the fact that he 
fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that are 
contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI 
for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other 
memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished 
sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what 
we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.  
If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u 
want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the 
Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.
Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately 
and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that 
this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think 
that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend 
so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning 
the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon 
as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai 
that require my presence there.
As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for 
you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing 
the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if 
we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist 
them in any way we can.

Sanjay,
Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.
Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

Subject: Hourly Gas Deals
Here is a high level summary of our discussions last week.  I believe that 
the calculations listed below under option 1 show how HPL would like to 
capture deals and see their postions all based on a 24 hour flow rate basis.  
Option 2 shows what the values would look like under an hourly flow basis.  
Bob:  Please review with the other trading directors and see if they also 
prefer to see everything on a 24 Hour Flow Rate basis.  Thanks!  -  Tommy"

Sara,
The name of the Senior Counsel at MARTA is Bruce Bomberg.  The phone number 
is 404-848-5200.
They are fully authorized to hedge.  Thay already sent a copy of the Board 
Resolution to Jay Williams.  Their Investment Policy also allows them to 
hedge.
MARTA has been hedging interest rates and fuel since the early 80's.  As a 
matter of fact their hedging program is featured in ""Corporate Investing"" 
magazine.  I have faxed a copy of this article for your attention.
Should you need to reach her, Thay Bishop's number is 404-848-5485.
Since we are one of their new counterparties in their long-running hedging 
program, they will be testing us on our confirmation and settlements 
process.  Thus it is very important to send their confirm as promptly as 
possible.  Your assistance in getting this confirm to them as soon as 
possible is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Craig"

Dear Ken,
It has been many years since we talked.  You may remember me as your
neighbor in Park Grove many years ago. I have followed your career in all
the business publications for many years and have cheered you on with the
innovative business model you have constructed at Enron.
The reason for my e-mail is to recommend Ginny's brother-in-law, Don Booker,
for Employment at Enron.  I have known Don since our days at Vanderbilt many
years ago.  He is a chemical engineer and has been with Scott Paper and with
SAPPI, the company that purchased one on their mills in Muskegon, Michigan
almost since graduation.  He is the pulp and utilities mill manager and has
experience in coal, gas and bio-mass co-generation.  He will take early
retirement from SAPPI soon and is looking to continue his career in the
power generation area.  Since your company is an innovator in this area I
thought you might be able to refer Don to someone in your organization that
could be of help.
On a personal level, I can highly recommend Don as a dedicated,  hard
working and intelligent employee with the technical and management knowledge
to make good business decisions.  We have had many talks over the years
about his management philosophy and I have always come away being impressed
with both his management and leadership skills.  Don conducts himself with a
high degree of integrity which is an essential leadership requirement.
Ken, as you can tell, I am highly recommending Don for a job at Enron.  If
you have an opening it would be in Enron's best interests to consider him.
If I can be of further help give me a call at (407) 293-4000 or e-mail me at
RDF@Finfrock.cc <mailto:RDF@Finfrock.cc> .  You can contact Don directly at
(616) 846-3177 or e-mail at  DBooker@charterMI.net.
Thanks for your attention Ken, and congratulations on your impressive story
at Enron.
Sincerely,
Bob Finfrock"

                       by Os Hillman
Horizontal Versus Vertical
Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the
Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
- (Exodus 2:12)
Moses saw the pain of his people. He saw the bondage and the
injustice. His heart was enraged, and he decided he would do
something. He would take matters into his own hands. The result
was murder. The motive was right, but the action was wrong. He
went horizontal instead of vertical with God. The action was
wrong. Moses fled to the desert, where God prepared the man who
would ultimately be the deliverer of a nation. But it took 40
years of preparation before God determined Moses was ready. He
was a professional businessman-a sheepherder. It was during the
mundane activity of work that God called on him to be a
deliverer.
Moses was like a lot of enthusiastic Christian businesspeople who
seek to solve a spiritual problem with a fleshly answer. The
greatest danger to the Christian businessperson is his greatest
strength-his business acumen and expertise to get things done.
This self-reliance can become our greatest weakness when it comes
to moving in the spiritual realm. We're taught to be problem
solvers. But, like Moses, if our enthusiasm and passion are not
harnessed by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will fail
miserably. Peter had to learn this lesson too. His enthusiasm got
him into a lot of trouble. But God was patient, just as He is
patient with each of us. Sometimes He must put us in the desert
for a time in order to season us so that Christ is allowed to
reign supreme in the process.
Before you act, pray and seek the mind of Christ until you know
it is God behind the action. Check it out with others. You may
save yourself a trip to the desert.

"Subject: Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues

Body: As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.
We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.
Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.
In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.
Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.
In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.
It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.
To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Body: Hey Hunter, A quick update.
Kevin Brady is up to speed on working with Colin and Chris on consolidating critical and noncritical notices for all the regions.
I have also passed on the idea of an operations page on the website to the other logistics managers and the central desk schedulers to get their ideas and insights on how to make this page beneficial to both the traders and schedulers.
A couple of ideas that have already been passed my way are:  	1) Incorporating the Gas Daily and Index historicals against production/storage by pipe so that we could project cash outs (Mark Schrab) 	2) A transportation rate matrix on the web site (Cora Pendergrass) 	3) Enron operations personnel contact page with phone numbers and pictures.
Much like the weather guys.
I laughed at first but Victor LaMadrid   		whom suggested this said that the East Desk Traders don't even know all of his schedulers.
4) An easy access to the pipelines meters and dunns numbers.
(Kevin Brady) 	5) Morning sheets updated with contract, constraint, and imbalance information from Sitara and Unify (Victor LaMadrid)  I have asked Kevin to consolidate all the ideas and then we can get together and decide which ones you want to place into production.

Pursuant to you commercial hiring policy, I am seeking your approval to hire Robert Downer as manager  (C $125K) working for Disturnal. I understand that you did a telephone interview with him. He has a genuine interest in leaving Goldman Sachs and moving to Calgary.
We would have him back up disturnal (JD's in kemo for the next 3 months and may not be able to work) and help with structuring derivative products. In addition, we need more bodies in trading - particularly if Lambie is shown the door.
fyi.... Stephane has agreed to move back to Calgary for May 1. I plan to give him a lump sum payment of C$10K for him agreeing to do this. He didnt ask for this but I think it is the right thing to do.
Please advise."

Subject: ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process
Body: 
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  
ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.
The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.
Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.
1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.
Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.
If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.
Thank you for your cooperation."

Louise,
Lloyd and I believe there are significant cost savings and efficiencies to be gained in the following recommendations.  We would like to present our final results Monday and would like to talk with you if possible prior to the meeting.  
With project Spark Gap, we have identified and are managing our top systems gaps and priorities for the next year.  We are setting up SAP codes for these efforts in order to more closely monitor IT progress and spending.  We have coordinated and are combining our systems requirements with the West and Canada desks in order to present a global power strategic systems vision.  
The following WHS/Retail Systems Analysis effort has made it clear that we should integrate our wholesale and retail trading systems, however, we believe organizational changes will be required in IT and Trading Support to achieve the benefits and savings.  
Please let us know if we can spend a few minutes with you prior to Monday's meeting.

Subject:	WHS/Retail Systems Integration Analysis - Results/Recommendations
Under the direction of Tim Belden, Kevin Presto, Lloyd Will, Anthony Dayao and Beth Perlman, Todd Busby and I have completed the 3 week analysis of wholesale and retail power systems integration.  Enclosed are the preliminary executive summary presentation and the detailed information/process flow diagrams.  
In summary, we identified at a high level commonality and critical dependencies across all main trading functions within retail and wholesale.  In order to ensure successful integration of systems and processes, the team has identified the following recommendations:
1.	Consider aligning the wholesale and retail support organizations with the Gas and Power Trading.  
2.   Manage business systems requirements for power globally with a program management team sponsored by the business owners.  Consider program managers responsible for the following three areas:
Trading - Top priority to provide wholesale and retail positions and booking of shaped deals
Billing/Settlements & Volume Management - Top priority to provide retail solutions and develop global strategic systems (gas & power)
Risk - Top priority to provide retail valuation and liquidation
We will schedule a meeting next week to review the results of our analysis.  I look forward to receiving your inputs.  
Thank you for your support on this effort.

Subject: Invitation to the EUROFORUM Conference ""Emissions Trading""
I received the message below from you, forwarded from Steve Kean severral 
weeks ago asking if we wanted to send anyone to speak at this conference, 
which John Palmisano previously spoke at.
They have suggested that Jeff speak on the topic of ""Joint Implementation 
(JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as a business opportunity.""   
While Palmisano was focused on these issues in the past, it seems to me that 
the current Enron strategy does not really include pursuing ""business 
opportunities"" related to these mechanisms, as they involve investment of 
capital in power projects in developing countries.  I don't think it would be 
a good fit for us at all right now.
While emissions traders in EGM are looking at the Kyoto process and the 
potential for global carbon trading, we are still a long way from there being 
any viable trading market whatsoever.  EES is interested in following the JI 
and CDM issues for potential opportunities related to energy efficiency.   
Our role has been to participate in the process and monitor the development 
of these issues and see if there are effects on our markets or 
opportunities.   I may have someone attend or may see if someone in Mark 
Schroeder's group in London can attend, but I would not recommend our 
speaking at this time.  
Please let me know if you have any questions,
Jeff Keeler

Matt,
Why do I have to pay for the cranes at GE's factory to get the turbine on a 
rail car?  Section 10.2 1 states that the Seller shall be responsible for 
loading Purchaser's mode of transportation upon arrival to the Delivery Point.
Also, I would expect crane would also be available at New Port News (major 
shipyard) and Houston to off-load the turbine and or generator.

Subject: Cost Breakout for Blue Dog #1 storage
Chris,
In response to your inquiry, the following is the cost breakout for the GE 
storage quote:
$50,000 = Long Term Preservation Procedures on the GTG
$198, 000 = Transportation to the storage yard (contract ref: Exhibit N-1)
$78,500 = Handling Costs (cranes) to upload on the method of transportation
$78,500 = Handling Costs (cranes) to offload in the storage yard
$64,000 = Storage costs through 30 JUN 01 (16k per month for MAR, APR, MAY, & 
JUN)
TOTAL = $469,000
Costs that are incurred ""up-front"" are 1,2,3,& 4.  After discussing this with 
GE, this is their Lump Sum price."

To Mr. Ken Lay,
I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.
Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.
The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Its the right thing to do.
Sincerely,
Leah Huddleston"

	Ladies & Gentlemen:
	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.
	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.
	I appreciate your patience.	
	Many thanks.

   info for exhibits A & C.
   Still missing the language you wanted to add instead of mine in sect.
   8.2,
   subsections (ii) & (iii).  Please see my notes in the document.  Once we
   get the wording agreed upon for these two subsections, we should have an

Attached is a draft Petition for Rehearing of the Commission's July 25th Order on refunds for the California and WSCC wholesale markets.  The Petition is largely procedural, focusing on the lack of any finding of abuse of market power or an adequate factual record to order refunds.  We also oppose the Pacific Northwest refund process and argue that marketers should have an opportunity to show their actual costs in any refund proceeding.
Petitions for rehearing are due at FERC on Friday, August 24th.  We will discuss this draft on the weekly conference call this Friday, August 17th.  In addition, please forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Julie Simon at jsimon@epsa.org no later than noon on Wednesday, August 22nd so that we can make this filing is a timely manner.

I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name ""Sierra Pacific Industries,

through the confirmation process. (The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on 
4/10.)
I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name 
we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority. Then I 
spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off 
of their new deal report. So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary, 
I changed the deal from it's ""new counterparty"" status.
Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you.

I just updated the Egan Exchange tickets and my worksheet for Nov and Dec.  I 
think we were out of balance by about 10,000 last night - my fault.

I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the 
following deals.  
Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.
Deal  Comment
473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections
473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.
Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  
Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan 
to Texas Gas ticket.
All of my information is on the following worksheet

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.
Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day."

I heard a rumor that the UI deal had an asset management aspect to it.  The

I'm trying to get my hands on any docs which might give some insight into 
some  different approaches.  Do you have anything you can email me?

Thanks.  I think we have alot of the same accounting issues here if the PPA 
is construed to be a lease.  If it is a lease, we have similar spending and 
EPC concerns as our other deals.  Do we know who the O&M contractor will be?  
If ENA or affiliate, we should not take on plant risk - just make sure our 
fair value O&M fee is the only amount at risk under the O&M agreement.  As of 
Friday, AA told us that even in a non-offtake situation, they may say we are 
in a lease if we take on plant risk through an O&M agreement.  This was new 
news to us.

I'm working with the commerial team on on PPA (and associated transactions) 
for Virginia Power.  The project involves the construction of  a peaker to 
supply some/most of the power, with the ability to supply from the market as 
well.  The plant has an 01 service date, so things are really picking up. 
Matt and Herman, this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few 
weeks ago.
Items on the immediate to do list include:
Executing a land option agreement
Closing on the land (or assign to City of Rocky Mount, and let them close)
Selling/transferring the land to the City of Rocky Mount; negotiate long term 
lease
Negotiating a PILOT agreement (payment in lieu of taxes) with the City
Negotiating fuel supply agreements
Selecting/contracting with EPC contractor - can it be NEPCO?
Long lead equipment purchases (?) - could be home for LM 6000's, but other 
equipment may be needed
Negotiate interconnection agreement
This deal is showing a lot of life, so I thought it might be helpful to give 
you a heads up.

Mike,
I spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix today regarding this spreadsheet, and he would like to see our data for every day from June 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001 as you calculated for the few random days throughout the summer.  The spreadsheet seems to indicate that we did not allocate Cogentrix on some of the days in question.  This information is contrary to the information Steve provided and must be explored further. 
Steve is getting impatient with this process.  He would like to see this come to a resolution as soon as possible.  I said that I understand his concern and we will do our best to resolve this in a timely matter.  
Kent, once Mike finishes the spreadsheet, I recommend that we meet and discuss our offer to Cogentrix.

Steve:?? Burney Forest Power has been running flat  out since June, 
delivering close to 100% of our capacity every hour, less an  eight day 
maintenance outage.? Unfortunately, we will be reducing our  generation next 
month due to a shortage of fuel caused by the USFS locking out  some of our 
suppliers from Sierra Nevada national forest lands because of a  threat from 
an environmental organization's lawsuit.? This action,  effective as of 
December 11th by the USFS, could affect some 10 to 14 biomass  facilities in 
varying degrees.??

It would appear to me that Senator Feinstein, Governor Davis,  and Secretary 
Richardson would take steps to help alleviate this situation if  the best

Subject: URGENT: REQUEST  TO PRODUCE AS MUCH POWER AS POSSIBLE
California Senator Feinstein, Governor Davis,  Secretary of Energy 
Richardson, and FERC Commissioner Hoecker held a joint  press conference 
related to the California energy problem.? They  indicated a critical need 
for supply TODAY to serve the California  marketplace.? Secretary Richardson 
indicated he will exercise his  emergency power under the Federal Power Act 
[section 202(c)] to direct  generation to California.? The Secretary 
indicated that DOE, under the  FPA, will set a fair price for the power.
?
IEP requests all its members to deliver  as much generation as possible to 
California ASAP in order to avert  potential shortages.? 
?
In addition, the Governor and Senator Feinstein  called for regionwide price 
caps and mandatory, reasonable long-term  contracts between generators and 
the utilities.? They made the point  that 4,000 - 5,000 MWs are being 
exported from the state, currently a lack  of adequate planning and 
scheduling of resources/planned outages exists, and  indicated that the CPUC 
would moved to implement forward contracting.?  
?
IEP will forward the formal statement from the  Press Conference (or a 
summary) as soon as  available."

I think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a
comprehensive solution is needed.  The only concern I have is the reference
at the end of the first paragraph to  ""the crisis grows daily with no clear
resolution offering long term relief in sight.""  In fact we do no have
several bills on demand side management, one by Wright on accelerating
repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary
conservation, at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery (AB-18X), and a
Bown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by AB-1X.  So I am
concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the
notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a
long term solution.  Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal
elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to
be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the
following elements....and then lay out our case.
Sandi, do you agree with my concerns?  Otherwise the elements of the letter
are fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative
language.  I will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of
review, even though we may later want to consoliate the entire package.  
Please call if you have any more questions.

In the current circumstances, Enron Europe senior management feel some discomfort in signing Corp guarantees under the power of attorney mechanism we have in place. As a result, we intend to revert to forwarding these documents to Houston, presumably yourself, for execution. 
I apologise for adding to your burden this way. Having done so, I would be grateful if you could do your usual sterling job in ensuring that these documents, which support our trading business are dealt with as promptly as your other responsibilities allow.

Jeff,
     I chuckled to read about Dan being the center of Dante's Inferno core,
but quickly was overcome more by disdain of the simpleton Mr. Palast's
wretched journalistic license.  Why don't you get Skillings, Michaels,
McCrae, Levin et al to answer all the preposterous revisionist pablum that
is saturating the marketplace as we speak?  Is there or was there only one
Jessie Knight who lived that 6-year hell to have crap like this spread
about?  Where are all the direct access/bilateral
contract/anti-poolco/anti-Hogan/anti-Harvard Electricity Group/anti-command
& control proponents?  It is sad for me to hear the deafening silence out of
a community that I helped lead to battle and to leave and see that most have
abandoned the cause to leave it the world to the government infidels that
want to and will certainly re-create the Gulag.

Insinger de Beaufort / Equity Trust Co. N.V.
This Netherlands company is the corporate manager for our Dutch international corporations, appx. 120.  They hold all the corporate records of these entities and they will not release them nor will they perform any services until they are paid. In addition I understand from Tim DeSpain that they are holding Treasury funds pending payment of fees, and that he is pursuing this issue too.   Equity Trust acts as the sole Director for these companies which means that only Equity Trust can sign corporate documents on behalf of these companies.  They prepare and register all necessary filings (numerous) with the Companies Register and advise us and keep us in line on Dutch corporate law. They will not advise us on Dutch bankruptcy proceeding requirements until we make good on the outstanding amount. 
Outstanding fees total EUR 173,595.16 which equals appx. US$154,309 plus we would need a float going forward so that they could draw from it.
Invoices are up to 12 months old and many of them are the responsibility of Enron Europe group.
None of the companies involved has filed for bankruptcy.

Dear Real Timers,
As I have been having to pull tapes lately, I cannot stress enough the 
importance of stating the hour for which you are trading when you make 
deals.  It is imperative that you state (as often as possible) the hours that 
you are trading for, and it is extremely helpful when you re-cap the sale at 
the end of your trade!! :) please...
There may be deals that we are going to loose the dispute for because neither 
trader (on either side) stated clearly what hour we were trading for. I'm 
relying on you guys to help me collect 100% on all our trades.
Please see or e-mail me with any questions.

Subject:=09Competitive Analysis Update #26- US Response to Terrorism
Importance:=09High
See below for update on situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus=
 plans in Congress.
RJ
1. =09The War on the Ground
For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s=
pecial forces ""inserted"" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special =
forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th=
e collected intelligence from various sources to ""snatch"" bin Laden and oth=
ers, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircr=
aft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikel=
y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.
Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu=
rrently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the g=
round and some special operation forces ""in-country.""  Also,  British Speci=
al Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de =
Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Adv=
ance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we=
ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just wes=
t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to =
Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored A=
C-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases=
 near Tashkent in Uzbekistan.=20
The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower,=
 ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-=
14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t=
he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS =
Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In additio=
n the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro=
und the HMS Invincible.
Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide =
air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli=
ance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban. =20
Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak=
istan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t=
he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini=
mum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in=
telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.
2.=09Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m=
easures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the =
$55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed.=
=20
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preferen=
ce over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to an=
esthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves=
 are beginning to go raw over corporate ""bailouts"" that have not yet includ=
ed anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of=
 the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec=
ts:
?=09Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item =
to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are pro=
bably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directl=
y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it =
can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big num=
ber if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes in=
to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c=
areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both=
 the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is li=
kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn.=20
?=09Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the rig=
ht medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you hav=
e already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the bud=
get flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those wh=
o pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, b=
ut not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t=
hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than ""t=
he rich."" Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in.=
=20
?=09Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It=
 is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo=
r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off you=
r list.=20
?=09Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining=
 programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp=
athetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There=
 are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but t=
he totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and heal=
th care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into s=
hock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis=
ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba=
iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with ""airline worker ass=
istance"" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still=
 try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-hous=
e rebellion.=20
?=09Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v=
irtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut i=
s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to=
 achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, bu=
t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke=
r assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an =
early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that =
seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been runni=
ng into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal co=
rporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay o=
n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative =
Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is th=
at companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse=
ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calcula=
ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened =
companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirer=
s depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses tha=
t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and =
the value of those deductions would obviously drop.=20
?=09Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vas=
t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t=
he same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to=
 delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that=
 all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed=
, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o=
n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no w=
ay to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the acce=
lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done=
 for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC=
. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, ther=
e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is=
 likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't=
 exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies.=20
?=09Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaura=
nt and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in =
mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handi=
cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p=
ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to=
 make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 =
billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail=
, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit =
sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make=
 the cut others will not, but they can add up fast.=20
?=09Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead=
ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the Preside=
nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d=
eals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr=
ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. I=
f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has =
some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn'=
t cost anything.
We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s=
ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in=
 the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time t=
o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact."

Attached are Enron's comments on Draft VI of the Electricity Bill 2000.  We 
note new and disturbing provisions in this draft that provide for 
interference of regulators in the business of Supply Companies and the 
unacceptable interference of the Central Government and State Legislatures in 
the freedom of transmission and supply enabling the diversion of supply to 
deficient regions.  Finally, there is a provision to cap supply prices in the 
event of extraordinary circumstances that is discussed.

This is just too funny not to pass along!  Have a great weekend!
Subject: Three Kick Rule 
A big city lawyer went duck hunting in South Louisiana. He shot and 
dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other 
side of a fence. 
As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on? his 
tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, ""I shot a 
duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going in to retrieve it."" 
The old farmer replied. ""This is my property, and you are not 
coming over here."" 
The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. 
and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and 
take everything you own."" 
The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things 
in Louisiana. We settle small disagreements like this with the Louisiana 
Three Kick Rule."" 
The lawyer asked, ""What is the Louisiana Three Kick Rule?"" 
The Farmer replied. ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me 
three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up."" 
The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he 
could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The 
old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and 
walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy 
work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second 
kick nearly ripped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his 
belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up. 
The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get 
to his feet and said, ""Okay, you old coot now it's my turn."" 
(I love this part......) 
The old farmer smiled and said, ""Naw, I give up. You can have 
the duck."" "

morning as I need to invoice and settle them today.  Please call me if you 
aren't the person who handles this book, and please forward this message on 
to the person who does.
Thanks for your help

Just so there's no confusion: I, too, have accepted a position with UBS War=
burg to be a part of its regulatory affairs team.

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what =
has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what=
 is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologi=
zing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the=
 last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that peo=
ple have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through=
 who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20
In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) wh=
o do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do=
, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen=
, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addi=
tion to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have ac=
cepted positions with UBS Warburg:

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
 well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
 get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
 the power procurement and delivery efforts.
As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
 the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.
The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
 or about February 6th.
Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
 over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
 team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.
Regards,
Tim"

Body: 
Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of 
weeks ago and loved it!
Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for 
you...
He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to 
see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay 
there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi 
and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another 
place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out 
later...
You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough 
sketch of the safari is as follows:
7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club
7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at 
Ngorongoro Crater Lodge
7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge
7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey
Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight 
arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to 
required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on 
when I receive it.
I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch 
again early next week.  
Take care, SRS"

Subject: Re: Fuel Specification Requirements  
Matt-
I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order 
for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no 
ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, 
I reduced the vanadium.
I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs 
included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The 
second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to 
increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash 
to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.
ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for 
column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file 
with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices 
over the soft cap.  It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority.  The 
ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked 
the Commission to so order.  Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the 
FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement.  I would 
like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this 
information with the ISO and EOB. 
I will also be asking members of EPSA what they plan to do during the 
conference call tomorrow.

Enron's shares were down $2.29 to $4.70 in early trading on the New York St=

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)
2001-11-21 12:38 (New York)
Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)
     (Updates with amount of debt in fourth paragraph.)
     Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares had
dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis, said lenders
extended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million note
due next week.
     Enron, which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction now valued at more than $23 billion,
said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to
repay the $690 million note. The repayment would strain cash
reserves Enron needs to back its trading operations, investors and
analysts said.
     The Houston-based company didn't say in its release who holds
the note, which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns
Brazilian natural-gas assets and was backed by Enron.
     The note is held by a group of banks led by the Citibank unit
of Citigroup Inc., Standard & Poor's said in a press release
yesterday.
      Enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a
restructuring of its debt, the company said in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire.
     ``We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary
lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' James Lee,
vice president of JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in the Enron
statement. ``We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders
to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to
and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Morgan has been advising
Enron on its merger with Dynegy.
     Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before the
merger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before the
end of the third quarter of 2002.
      Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2
billion in cash or credit lines.
     Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell
$1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading. Before the
announcement that it had renegotiated the $690 million note, its
shares had fallen as much as 42.78 percent, the lowest level in
more than a decade.
     Dynegy fell $2.50, or 6 percent, to $39.20. Shares of
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 49
cents to  $87.02
Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)
2001-11-21 11:49 (New York)
Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)
     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)
     Houston, Nov. 21, (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp., the
biggest energy trader, and Dynegy Inc. fell for a second day on
concern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegy
can be completed.
     Enron tumbled as much as 33 percent, and Dynegy dropped as
much as 6.7 percent. Enron's bonds also fell. The company's 6.4
percent notes maturing in July 2006 were bid at 62 cents and
offered at 66 cents, traders said. They sold at about 72 cents
yesterday.
     Institutional investors sold shares of both companies after
Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer downgraded them to
``market perform'' from his ``recommend'' list, other analysts
said.
     The Dynegy bid ``did not eliminate customer concerns about
Enron's liquidity and long-term viability,'' Goldman Sachs said
in its report. ``We now believe that it will be difficult for
Enron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that
Enron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide
cash or letters of credit to back routine transactions.''
     Fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for Enron to 50
cents from $1.35. Enron had been expected to make $1.90 next
year, the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.
     Enron said Monday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the Houston-based energy trader may run
out of cash. The company said in a regulatory filing it has less
than $2 billion in cash or credit lines.
     It also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its
credit rating may force it to repay a $690 million note next
week. Enron said yesterday the terms of the notes, which it
guaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian
natural-gas assets, are being renegotiated and that it had a
``verbal indications'' that the maturity of the notes will be
extended.
     The company's dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federal
investigation and a management shakeup. Dynegy plans to complete
its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules.
     Mirant Corp., Aquila Inc. and other big energy traders are
doing fewer transactions with Enron as concerns increase about
its credit rating and ability to finance daily business,
executives said yesterday.
     Enron's stock fell $2.28, or 32 percent, to $4.71 in
late-morning trading. Earlier, it touched $4.67, its lowest price
in more than a decade. The shares have plummeted 92 percent this
year. Dynegy fell $2.70, or 6.5 percent, to $39.00. The shares
had dropped 26 percent this year.
U.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint
2001-11-21 10:24 (New York)
U.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint
     New York, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list of
companies whose shares are moving in U.S. markets Wednesday, Nov.
21. The stock symbol is in parentheses after the company name.
Major Moving Stocks:
     Enron Corp. (ENE) fell $1.54, or 22 percent, to $5.45 and
traded as low as $5.44. The energy trader shares fell for a second
day on concern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) can be completed.
Other Moving Stocks:
     Cardiac Science Inc. (DFIB) rose 51 cents, or 16 percent, to
$3.65 and traded as high as $3.89. The maker of equipment used to
restore a normal heartbeat to patients in cardiac arrest said the
San Diego City Council approved an agreement for the company to
deploy automated external defibrillators in the region. The
company made the announcement in a press release distributed by PR
Newswire. Officials couldn't immediately be reached to comment.
     Guidant Corp. (GDT) rose $4.18, or 8.9 percent, to $51 and
traded as high as $51.50. The maker of products to treat heart
disease said a study showed implantable defibrillators cut deaths
by 30 percent in heart-attack survivors, potentially expanding the
$1.9 billion market for the product.
     Portal Software Inc. (PRSF) fell 34 cents, or 15 percent, to
$1.89 and traded as low as $1.64. The provider of Internet-billing
programs said in a release distributed by Business Wire that it
forecasts a loss of 9 cents to 10 cents a share in the fourth
quarter ending Jan. 31. The company is expected to lose 11 cents,
the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call. Officials
couldn't be reached to comment.
     TriQuint Semiconductor Inc. (TQNT) fell $1.99, or 10 percent,
to $17.56 and traded as low as $17.35. The communications-
equipment chipmaker said it would report fourth- and first-quarter
results at the low end of previous forecasts. TriQuint was cut to
``neutral'' from ``buy'' in a report by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Cos. analyst Samuel May.
Tickers: ENE DFIB GDT TQNT
     Money flows, the difference between the value of trades made
at a higher price than the previous trade and those made at a
lower price, may also appear for some stocks. These inflows and
outflows show whether people are willing to pay more for a stock
that's rising, or to sell a stock that's falling for less. If not
it's a signal the share price may soon change direction.

and banks have opened new credit lines. An Enron collapse would cause weeks=
 of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy trader=
s, and it would cause big losses for the Houston company's creditors.=20
Just before noon EST, Enron announced in a press release that it had extend=
ed to mid-December a $690 million obligation that was due next week. It als=
o said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $450 =
million of a previously announced $1 billion secured credit line that has J=
.P. Morgan Chase as its lead banker.=20
Investors have been fleeing Enron since the company last month disclosed a =
$1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party hedging transactions. T=
he Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Enron deals with related p=
arties. The October disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested t=
he company hadn't been forthcoming about the true state of its finances, an=
d it showed that Enron was facing serious liquidity problems.=20
Those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when Enron agreed t=
o be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy. But Enron's disclosure Monday that i=
t faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the =
exits. In the Wednesday release, Enron CEO Ken Lay said his company was sti=
ll committed to the merger: ""We continue to believe that this merger is in =
the best interests of our shareholders, employees and lenders."" Dynegy late=
r issued a press release indicating it is ""continuing our confirmatory due =
diligence"" regarding the merger. Neither Enron nor Dynegy returned calls se=
eking comment.=20
After plunging 23% Tuesday to $6.99, Enron was down a staggering 34% at one=
 point Wednesday. It moved slightly higher after the midday press release t=
o trade at $4.90. Enron shares have lost more than 80% of their value since=
 the company issued its third-quarter earnings release last month. Dynegy d=
ropped $2.44, to $39.26, though it remains substantially above premerger le=
vels.=20
At the heart of Enron's trouble is the sense that the company isn't letting=
 on the full extent of its troubles. The selloff in Enron shares began in e=
arnest Oct. 16, when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call t=
hat it would take a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party tra=
nsactions. Critics of the company said those deals, in which the company di=
d business with separate entities involving Enron managers, raised serious =
ethical and disclosure issues.=20
The Dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for Enron, since as a b=
ig trading partner Dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of Enron's sit=
uation. As a result, shares in both companies rallied after the deal's anno=
uncement. But Monday's disclosure that Enron faced $690 million in bond pay=
ments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges=
 than it has detailed. According to a Merrill Lynch report cited in The New=
 York Times Wednesday, Dynegy wasn't aware of the $690 million obligation. =
Critics of the deal wondered whether Enron had told Dynegy about all its ob=
ligations. <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10003860.html>=20
Liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a fili=
ng of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $5 billio=
n of cash in recent weeks. By the end of 2002, Enron has to find around $9 =
billion to pay back various obligations. It had $1.2 billion in cash on han=
d as of Nov. 16, according to the filing.=20
Tellingly, Dynegy shares haven't plunged along with Enron, suggesting that =
investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for Enron but not fo=
r Dynegy. At current levels, Enron shares are trading at more than a 50% di=
scount to the Dynegy offer.=20
J.P. Morgan has taken a leading role in helping Enron. It has lent funds an=

DYNEGY, ENRON SAY MERGER TO PROCEED
By Myra P. Saefong
1:52 PM ET Nov 21, 2001
WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Merger partners Enron and Dynegy restated their
commitment Wednesday to completing a deal, on the heels of embattled
Enron's announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay
off a $690 million note set to come due next week.
""We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,""
said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive,  in a
statement.
Shares of Enron (ENE) recovered slightly in afternoon  trading but
remained under pressure.
On heavy volume, the stock -- which had touched $4 earlier in the
session -- was down $1.83 to trade at $5.16, a new 10-year low. Some 84
million shares had changed hands.
Enron declined 23 percent Tuesday after the company revealed the
upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings.
Meanwhile, Dynegy shares lost $1.83 to stand at $39.87.
Enron said that the lead bank on the $690 million debt agreed to extend
the maturity date to mid-December, which will give the company time to
restructure the facility, and added it expects to further restructure
its debt.
""We ... believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to
enhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet, and address
upcoming maturities,"" said Jeff McMahon, chief financial officer, in a
statement.
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it and other lenders are committed to
helping Enron improve its financial position.
Also, Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with Dynegy and said
it closed on a previously announced $450 million line of credit from
J.P. Morgan, collateralized by the company's Northern Natural Gas Co.
Enron -- which is being acquired by its smaller rival Dynegy (DYN) at a
fire-sale price -- revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Monday that it had to pay off or refinance $690 million in debt
obligations by next Monday or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in
additional payments.
If Enron had missed that deadline and didn't post collateral, investors
had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of
Enron's limited partnerships, the unusual business entities at the
center of the company's murky transactions currently under
investigation.
The SEC filing of Monday also contained yet another restatement of
financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more
than four years of restated earnings figures.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B35D690E0%2D13BE%2D43D9=
%2D9644%2D1B1CF4896115%7D>
Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock to
""market performer"" from its ""U.S. recommended list,"" citing ""major""
liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the
business it has lost.
CIBC World Markets also cut Enron to a ""hold"" from a ""buy.""
Commerzbank weighed in Wednesday, saying Enron's viability is in doubt.
""We believe the filing clearly shows that Enron remains in a precarious
financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt,""
analysts Andre Meade and Andrew Smith wrote. ""It appears that Enron's
situation could worsen in a number of ways.""
Though Enron's most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation, Meade and Smith characterized the information as ""piecemeal.""
""It appears that the full extent of Enron's problems is not currently
known,"" they said in a note, cautioning clients against investing in
Enron."

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 24, 2001
FERC's Wood Looking for a Few Good Executives 
Chairman designate Pat Wood III is looking for a few good energy executives to teach him and his FERC colleagues the ins and outs of the natural gas and electricity markets, specifically how to detect when something ""smelly"" is taking place. 
He's willing to pay a maximum salary of $133,700 -- which is what he'll be making as chairman -- for up to 10 executives who are interested in the task. That's the ""top payment"" that Congress will allow, Wood noted. He's also looking to hire an unspecified number of executives at a salary in the $115,000 range. Potential applicants should call him directly at (202) 208-0388, Wood said during an interview with NGI Thursday. 
""We've tried like crazy to get people. We can't compete on dollars...Government never competes on dollars. You got to get people who believe in this thing. There are people who want to do...something good for the [public]. I'm going to find those people,"" he noted, adding that this was a top priority with him. 
For interested executives, Wood said, ""I'm going to give you the top [salary] I can pay you in the U.S. government, and I'm going to give you a helluva great workload in a critical industry that everybody in America depends on."" 
He wants the executives to show him and the other four Commissioners ""how it works."" For example, ""hedging and derivatives are great words"" that are often tossed around, but Wood would like to know exactly how they work. ""All five of us need to know everything about this business."" 
Wood acknowledged that the new Market Observation Resource Center, which enables FERC to monitor the markets on a real-time basis throughout the day, has been a great addition at the Commission, but he says the agency needs people to decipher the data that it generates. ""Getting the data is one thing, but having somebody that can assimilate that into something that tells you a story"" is what FERC needs. 
He firmly believes that reported incidents of price manipulation and other market-power abuses will drop as the Commission's knowledge of the markets grows. ""As we get smart on this, they won't try this stuff,"" Wood said, adding that it will ""let them know [that] we're watching."" 
Still, he admits that spotting price manipulation won't be easy for the Commission. ""I think it's hard...even if you're really good at it."" "

Subject: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales
Body: 
Douglas Robb
6403 Brook Hollow Ct.
Tampa, FL 33634
robberbaronusa@yahoo.com
To Mr. Ken Lay,
I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.
Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.
The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.
Sincerely,
Douglas Robb"

John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity 
for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is 
less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work 
product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators 
becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel.  
I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do 
you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E?  
As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the 
new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning 
activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another 
contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue 
up in Flagstaff.
Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and 
thoughts.

Subject: RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th
Larry,
Good thoughts.  I believe Rod Boschee told me he was putting the same 
thoughts on the agenda which cover your items 1-4.  However, I will take a 
close look at his draft agenda and make certain that the equivalent thoughts 
are on there.  Now, about item 5 and your closing paragraph.   Item No. 5 - I 
do not want to open the issue of the ""PCB Model"" to PG&E at this time.  Maybe 
later, but not now.  As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph - Randy 
Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators ""deconned"".  We took great pains last 
fall (when we had the separators down) to test and decon them - so we could 
establish a ""base line"".  Why would we take the system down and change the 
filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility?  If we 
did that - then hypothetically - next fall (2002) when we took the system 
down and changed the filters - if we took any wipe samples - it could contain 
residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past 
twelve months.  It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the 
separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will 
know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up.  I'm 
open to further argument on it - but that is the way Randy and I see it at 
this point in time.  
On the subject of the selection of the contractor - Randy and I believe that 
you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best 
job and is most dependable.  Remember that PG&E had confidence in Vector (at 
least that is what I recall from last fall).  So, if we go with a new 
consultant - will PG&E have the same confidence?  Also, you and Tiny must 
make certain that the firm we use has some ""acceptable"" credentials.  What 
PCB issues have they handled in the past, etc.  
I will be glad to discuss any of this with you or Tiny as needed.
Thanks, John Shafer

John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E:
1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E 
interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional 
separator installations.
2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their 
equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs?
3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E 
system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be 
nice   depicting this.
4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry 
on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing  
liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our 
commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 
5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study 
with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort 
to  show our commitment.
John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to 
decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.  
If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line 
out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to 
discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any 
longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do 
the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is 
$$$$$$$, although they do a good job. 
Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them 
your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you 
plan on asking him to attend the meeting........

Larry,
Glad you got this audit out of the way.  I will be needing your agenda items 
for our meeting with PG&E so we can send them to Rod Boschee.  Think it over 
carefully, and let's have all of the items we need to discuss ready to go 
over with them.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Randy and I will fly out 
early on July 24 and maybe we can have some time that afternoon and all day

Don, Ive been requested by John Shafer to attend a meeting with one of 
Transwestern's biggest customers during the same time period of the 
consolidated audit  in the Dakotas.  I am requesting that I be relieved from 
the environmental audit responsibility due to the sensitivity and importance 
of the meeting with PG&E.  Your understanding in this will be appreciated.

Most of you are aware that Unify experienced some major performance issues as 
we tried to close out the month of July.  Not to go into any details but 
there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the 
issues we saw on Monday and to a lesser degree on Tuesday.  Almost all of the 
issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of Sybase which is 
used for Unify's database.  Jeff Johnson and his team are putting together a 
plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in 
acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for 
August.  The short term tactical plans include the following:
Enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the 
amount of data grows.
Test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of Sybase which will address 
some of the issues.  This may also require some hardware changes as to where 
we store certain data.  We will also need some user help in stress testing 
prior to moving to production.
Addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled.  
I have been told that we still have transactions going back to Jan of 99 that 
have not been finaled or closed out.  This puts quite a load on the PMA and 
accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see 
what if any action should be taken with these transactions.
Once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little 
time to absorb the tremendous growth we've been seeing via EOL  then we will 
focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions.  These 
include the following:
Rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be 
much more scalable.
Moving off of Sybase and on to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.  It will be 
easier to move Microsoft SQL Server but we have to be sure it is the right 
solution in the long term.
Jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed 
plan.  Needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best 
people are working on these efforts.  This will slow down major enhancement 
efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and 
nominations.  We will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical 
solutions.  In the mean time feel free to contact me at x-36858 or Jeff at 
x-39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail.  Thanks!  -

Subject: Staffing for Doorstep
Body: 
Cc: shona.wilson@enron.com
Bcc: shona.wilson@enron.com
Since we couldn't get us all together on the phone (Sally, you're out of the 
office), I wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we've all been 
having on Doorstep.  After talking with Rick Carson,  Shona and I see several 
alternatives:
Our Needs:
1) Database Management
2) Staff to do the deal test and write the report
No matter what, we want to use Rick Carson's group to maintain the Doorstep 
database.  
Our Goals:
The one open question we need to resolve is whether or not Rick Buy does in 
fact want Rick Carson's group to develop trading expertise with the goal of 
being able to do Doorstep visits alone without the involvement of Market Risk 
Management (MRM) or Sally's (Ops) group.  Rick Carson indicated that was his 
understanding from talking to Rick Buy.  If that is the case, we should 
select alternative #1 below, despite the inefficiencies.
If we are simply trying to carry out the Doorstep initiative in the most 
efficient manner possible, it seems Carson's involvement is not actually the 
way to get there.
Alternatives:
1)  Include Rick Carson's group to staff the deal test while including them 
in planning, interviews, etc. 
  - RC does not have low level people to do deal test only; his people are 
experienced managers/directors who would only
  be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business; 
it is also a management problem for his staff to be
  under someone else's direction so he wants their more active involvement
  Pros: - inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them 
documenting the findings in the report
   - training of a RC's group - is this in fact a goal?
   
  Cons: - no real need for a 3rd level of ""brains"" - we just need brawn
   -involvement by 3 or more people in interviews might be intimidating to 
target personnel, may be inefficient, etc.
   - planning and oversight with 3 groups ""in charge"" is inefficient and 
could cause accountability question
2) Don't use Rick Carson's group except for database management: Instead, 
consider one of the following:
 A) Have the MRM and Ops people assigned to the Doorstep do the deal test and 
write the report; bring a staff level person from MRM or Ops to
  do the deal test
   
  Pros: Efficient, keeps expertise and training within our two groups who can 
benefit most directly as trading is our focus (vs. Carson's group), no
   issue with managing staff, etc.; 
  Issue: Do our two groups (MRM and Ops) have resources necessary to devote? 
 B) Outsource to AA
  Cons: Little leverage on timeliness of report, not developing in house 
expertise, expensive, 
 C) See if there are other internal resources like the Business Risk 
Management / Energy Assurance Services group (Internal Audit), or 
accountants   from Causey's other groups, etc.
Assuming Buy does  not actually plan to transfer responsbility for Doorstep 
to Carson's group, I think Shona and I are leaning toward 2A  - it depends on 
what you two think about it - I think our staff level people would welcome 
the opportunity to participate and see other offices - the question is can we 
afford time wise for them to do so.  But if we want to train Carson's group 
with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary RAC Doorstep interface, 
we can do that instead.
Let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans.  
Regards,
Cassandra."

Body:

Jeff,
Understanding there are many nuances and directions for discussing a contract 
restructuring with the QFs, I am attaching a general outline of a potential 
structure we (Chris Foster and I)  would like to pitch to Wheelabrator.  
Could you look this over and provide your initial comments.  I have thought 
of providing more specific terms in regards to sharing % and potential up 
front payments for the optionality but would like you input.  For example, we 
could apply an option value to the deal.  In Wheelabrator's case, the 
intrinsic reverse toll (ie our ability to provide market based power to the 
IOU using SRAC at 9210 HeatRate) is in the range of $4-5 MM for the Malin gas 
pricing and $9-11 MM if we assume the combined Socal/Malin curve.  If we 
lower the contract heat rate to 8500 the intrinsic value drops about $2 MM.  
The other alternative, which may be the easiest to sell,  is to just agree 
with the IOU/PUC on a lower heat rate and the Malin curve.  
Another value upside, and probably the highest value in the short run, is to 
be able to optimize the QF contract deliverability obligations. (ie.  in a 
very simplified case, if the obligation is only 80 percent, then deliver 80 
%). 
I will give you a call or call me when you have a free moment.

                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Sunday, November 11, 2000
  Dear Friend,
  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.
  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.
  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.
  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.
  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.
  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.
  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.
  Sincerely,
  Don Evans

Subject: For Subscribers Only
Body: 
Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,
I'm about to reveal a BRAND-NEW wireless
recommendation to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited
about this opportunity that I want to share the
details with you, too.
You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!
Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.
First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.
Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either -- these royalties get paid
on a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!
And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in
the following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research
and development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.
I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I reveal the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which gets released TOMORROW.
To make sure that you're on board for ALL the profits
we expect to make with this wireless dominator, all
you have to do is accept a RISK-FREE trial to
Technology Investing today.  (Just visit
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0VN135
to do so now.)  When you do, you'll get the December
issue of Technology Investing as soon as it's released
tomorrow, and I'll send you up to 5 FREE bonus reports
with all of the details on my other tech and biotech
recommendations.  Plus, your subscription will be
fully covered by my 100% MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE.  That
means if you're not completely satisfied within the
first 6 months, I'll refund every single penny you've
paid.  No questions asked.
Don't miss out on this monster profit opportunity!
Join Technology Investing today, and buy this hot
stock tomorrow for 50% gains in the next 12 months.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?
Thanks,
Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

 Day 6-10 Discussion:  The 6-10 day period shows the polar vortex locked in=
to place over the Great Lakes. It is also possible that Southern jet stream=
 energy will undercut this polar air spinning up a winter storm in the Sout=
h that could head up the East Coast. This storm is clearly in the speculati=
ve stages and should be watched. But, the cold is not speculative, it is re=
al. I am very confident in the evolution of this at long last. It appears t=
o be a fairly long lasting event, the question now is how long and how seve=
re. One extreme example of how strong this potential may be down the road w=
as a report earlier this week that record high barometric pressure readings=
 were approached in Mongolia. The center of this Siberian high had a pressu=
re of around 32.00"" of mercury. The temperature at the time of the reading =
was 41 below zero. Most of the ! models on a hemispheric scale are now lini=
ng up the surface highs from the U.S. Northwest to the Pole. The Canadian m=
odel in particular shows some very frigid air in the NW territories on its =
Day 10 depiction. If this trend continues, it could be extremely cold early=
 in 2002.  Note: This is my final weather commentary until January 2'nd of =
2002. Best wishes for a happy holiday season.     Day 6: Wednesday, Decembe=

Subject: Alliance Info Alert: FERC Meeting/Filings
Body: 
Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:
At its brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a stripped-down consent agenda, 
without discussion, as described below.  Following this summary is an updated 
listing of filings at FERC.
In particular, FERC:
(1) Approved, 3-1, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, an extension of the existing 
temporary $1,000/MWh bid caps in the ISO-NE energy, automatic generation 
control and operating reserve markets through March 31, 2001.
(2) Rejected an aspect of ISO-NE's July 28 CMS/MSS compliance filing, namely 
its proposed Installed Capacity (ICAP) deficiency charge, and directed the 
ISO to reinstitute the previous, administratively-determined deficiency 
charge that the Commission required the ISO to revert to in its June 28 
Order; other aspects of the filing will be addressed separately, FERC 
indicated.
(3) Accepted in part, and rejected in part, American Transmission Company, 
LLC.'s (ATC) proposed OATT and rates, with Comm. Massey concurring.  Among 
other things, FERC rejected ATC's innovative rate proposal, without prejudice 
to ATC submitting a new FPA Section 205 rate filing, based on its finding 
that ATC's ROE and other rate proposals amounted to a ""request for the 
innovative rates that we have indicated we would consider in an RTO 
context.""  ATC sought such rates prior to joining an approved RTO, FERC 
specified, distinguishing this case from its September 28 Order authorizing 
innovative rate treatment for International Transmission Company.
(4) Accepted for filing TransEnergie's two filed compliance reports on its 
procedures for reassignment of transmission rights and the results of its 
open season, respectively.
(5) Rejected proposed amendments filed by two Southern Energy parties to 
their respective Reliability Must Run (RMR) Agreements with CA ISO, after 
finding the amendments were inconsistent with the terms of a prior RMR 
settlement.
Numerous significant items were stricken, including the Alliance RTO 
compliance filing (CAE-27), the Southern petition concerning its RTO plans 
(CAE-23), and the Illinois Power-MISO withdrawal docket (CAE-16).

to hire high-quality Gas Options Traders.  If you, or someone you know, has
an interest in learning more about these opportunities, please contact me.
If the timing is not right for you at this time, I've included my contact

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning.   Have begun to see short-term intraday topping patterns.   Natural has reached its mid-range of price objectives.  See no rationale  for holding significant length here.  Winter months seem especially high  and most vulnerable to correction.  The first hour's negative close  produced a sell signal against today's high.  Still too early to ascertain  if this is the end of entire up move.  Have targets into early next week,  but mkt. has reached where it needed to."

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably

With pre-bid coming up, how should I handle CES? Who will be responsible for

Superty asked me to be the point person initially, so maybe he has another 
person in mind (Ed Terry or Kathy Kelly - secondary contacts) that he would 
like to handle it besides someone on the Texas desk. This way it could free 
our group up from that task. Part of the reason I was handling it was because 
I wanted to make sure nothing that affects Texas slips through the cracks,

Dave,
I spoke with Frank Gardner, the acting President of the mine.  The mine has 
shut down due to high power prices and they are evaluating reopening it later 
this year.  John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very 
well (Frank acknowledged that).  EPMI has served this load in the past and 
made numerous proposals to them during the past year.  Montana rejected 
these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below 
the current forward market price.  John has also proposed various 
cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.  John will discuss 
their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.  I do not 
think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long 
and the industrials' credit is marginal.  We will keep you posted if anything 
materializes. 
Regards,
Chris

There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, 
Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to 
talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might 
propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for 
energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other 
companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for 
transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably 
discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.
What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?
What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?
Should legal counsel be in attendance?
Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?"

Hot Flash:
The ALJ in the case (Tim Kenney) just advised me that he is so busy that he
will not even read any responses to the PG&E petition for issuing a security
interest in accounts receiveables.  Don't ask if this is due process--it's
not.  The commission is clearly going to grant this authority at the
emergency meeting tomorrow at 1:30.  In voice mails from Travis, he
recommended voicing some concerns so that we can raise the issue later if we
feel Enron's interests have been prejudiced by how PG&E implements this.  I
also received the indication that EES and ENA were very concerned about
filing anything negative that could upset the present arrangments with PG&E
on DASR matters.  I recommend not filing.  I do not believe we need to
express any concerns to raise them later.  We are not in a formal waiver
situation, and the commission is acting before any reasonable responses were
possible.  Let me know by VOICE MAIL what you want to do.  If you want
something filed, please also advise my associate, Jeanne Bennett who will be
monitoring this issue in the office today while I am in Sacramento.  Her

suppliers issue  
                    03:43 PM
 
 
Jim -- the following are our concerns about PG&E's proposal/possible points
to make in a response:
1.   Enron would be one of the largest unsecured creditors in the event of
a PG&E bankruptcy; our claim may become even larger  depending on the
extent to which we acquire additional claims against the utilities through
the PX or ISO.  We are therefore interested in any action that would reduce
the pool of assets available to unsecured creditors.
2.   This proposal may be to our benefit, or to our detriment.  There is
not a great deal of detail in the proposal currently on the table, and
Enron needs additional information in order to evaluate the proposal.
Certainly, we need to evaluate this in light of other developments.
3.   The proposal contemplates pledging ""existing and future"" receivables
to secure obligations owed to gas suppliers; PGE shows approx. $1.3 billion
in A/R as of 9/30; will that (or an amount of like magnitude) be pledged as
security under this plan?  Granting gas suppliers security may be fine with
us, but we don't have a great interest in OVER-collateralizing their
positions.  More current information on the current A/R balances and the
extent to which obligations to suppliers will be secured will be helpful.
4.   Do they intend to extend this security to ALL gas suppliers, or only
those that are refusing to supply PGE under current circumstances?
5.   Do they intend to secure obligations on a going-forward basis only, or
will they also secure their obligations with respect to payables that have
already accrued?
6.   PG&E is scheduled to make a couple of large payments to ENE tomorrow;
what is PG&E's ability to make those payments for gas already delivered?
7.   Given the extension of the DOE order, it seems that consideration of
this petition could be delayed for a few days to allow interested parties
sufficient time to evaluate its implications.
Give me a call with any questions.
In light of the DOE extension of the emergency gas supply order, there
should now be adequate time for PG&E  to respond to these points and
clarify their proposal.

"Subject: HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List
Body: I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of  what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol""  into these discussions.
To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not  anticipated to be a formal legal document.
Instead, Anne envisions simply  e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of  information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.
Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled  exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron)  to Steve Jackson (AEP).
Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally  documented.
Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the  original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for  gas to be delivered in the month of May.
He has worked with Enron's treasury  group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband  in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an  Amendment to that agreement.
As of today, Legal has completed revisions to  that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's  Treasury group for her review.
Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the  amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.
We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition  issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of  you.
This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have  to date captured the status of transition issues.
Items that only require  actions by Enron will be our ""to do"" list.
Each item has a due date and we  will update you weekly on progress.
Those items that fall under the AEP list  or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we  will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or  memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.
I believe that this should satisfy your  requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".
We will also update you  weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and  AEP.
I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update  on the HPL sale.
To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest  that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:    1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so  that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and  their status, or    2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a  firsthand update to the two of you.
Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can  incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

I am sending you a copy of the subpoena ""served"" on Glanville. I have just 
left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me 
this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept. You will notice that it 
is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter. I doubt it 
is effective. Feel free to call Glanville if you like. His no. is on the 
document.
Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was ""served"" last Sat the 
3rd. I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up 
with him. Linda's no. is 713-853-6104. Gary Grote's no. is 713-650-3131. Of 
course you can always call Kevin.
I am on spring Break but am checking messages. My cell no. is 713-410-6128.

Body: 
Your free trial expires today...
Dear Reader:
A new world is unfolding and you're in it.  The industry you know is
changing into one no one has ever seen and you'll probably be a part of it.
That's why we've created Restructuring Today - to report to you the
twists, the plans, failures, strategies, shocks, absurdities, new sales
and buying methods as energy and communications converge into American's
biggest industry.
Add the $220 billion power industry to the $80 billion gas industry and
merge in the $200+ telecom, cable and internet industries and you're
talking big bucks.  Restructuring Today is focused down the road,
reporting where the industry's headed every business day.
Our editors will tell you what the CEOs making the big decision are
thinking and planning on.  And those editors cover more seminars that
you could imagine going to (or paying for).  They're guided by a network
of correspondents in state capitals - most of them business editors of
important newspapers.
Can you ask questions?
Of course you can call 1-800-486-8201 anytime with your questions
because that keeps us up on what our readers want to know.  The news is
readable because Restructuring Today's editors write the way people talk
- not in the language of the Federal Register.
Analysis:  Restructuring Today is not written by recent journalism
graduates.  Our editors are directed not to write what the news is but
to report what the news means.  It may seem opinionated but
Restructuring Today's analysis is frequently mentioned when we survey
readers about what they find useful in the daily reports.
Urgent:  We have enjoyed being able to send you some samples of what
Restructuring Today does and if you would like to benefit from our
special, unique focus on convergence and new markets, simply fax the
order from at the end of today=01,s issue (attached) and I'll make sure
you don't miss a single, vital issue.
Cordially,
Season Hawksley

reduction of 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.=20
2) On the domestic level, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo=

Good to hear from you Kim.  First, I did get the check.. I've been out of the office for over two weeks so it will be cashed this week sometime. Sorry about that.   I had not heard anything about a suprise party for Rich in Houston but regardless, with Red Rock, annual outages etc...  it would probably be a difficult time for me.  If I can help with anything please give me a yell.  The next trip to Houston, will probably tie in with a family vacation to Tx. sometime in July.  
We are making arrangements to give Rich a retirement party in the field as well.  I was responsible for donations as you know (got to keep it quiet now but we are getting him a four wheeler).  Rick and Arnie are setting up the party which will probably be on April 13 and most likely in Belen, Nm.  
Again, the check will be cashed this week. and thanks to all of you....  My wife is making a card and we will have your names included...

Tiny, 
I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.  Will you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.
Good luck on Bisti!
Thanks, Kim."

Subject: COP-7 Update -- 11/08
Body: 
COP-7 Update - November 8 
The negotiations continue today, in closed sessions, and aim to conclude tomorrow afternoon. The following key sticking points remain and have been sent to Ministers for final resolution:
Fungibility of emissions allowances, and credits generated under Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism.  Enron strongly supports full fungibility among allowances and credits.
The nature of compliance rules under the market-based mechanisms still need to be agreed upon. Specifically, whether the eligibility requirements to participate in the mechanisms are deemed as mandatory and whether parties that wish to use the mechanisms must agree to the compliance rules under Protocol.  Enron supports strong compliance rules and eligibility criteria, but urges that once a credit generating project has been approved by oversight bodies (CDM Executive Board; JI Supervisory Body) that the credits are secure (assuming no project-oriented defaults).
Sinks - 1) how sinks allowances will be able to be used in the first commitment period, 2008 - 2012 (hierarchy of credit submission). The Bonn Agreement stated that sinks allowances could not be banked.  The European Union seeks agreement on the order of submission of all credits used for compliance in the first commitment period.  2) Russia's request for an increase in its domestic sinks allocation in the first budget period.  The European Union has the most problem with increasing Russia's allocation and is working bilaterally with Russia to resolve this issue.  From an Enron perspective, the amount of Russian sinks allowances will likely impact prices and demand for greenhouse gas emissions allowances and credits, especially in the first commitment period. 
The nature and scope of what must be reported by national governments is still being debated.  Many of these are technical issues, but are important to ensure the integrity of the emissions trading system and tracking of national compliance with treaty obligations.
Of note, the oversight body of the Clean Development Mechanism, the Executive Board, has been largely appointed and is set to meet tomorrow afternoon.  Some of the countries represented as full members include Brazil, Costa Rica, Morocco, and Antigua and Barbuda. Amb. John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), a leader of this process (and good contact), will likely be elected to serve as the President of Executive Board.
Amb. Raul Estrada (Argentina), the man largely associated with hammering out the Kyoto Protocol, has been appointed to serve as a Chair of one of the key implementing bodies of the Conference of the Parties.  His leadership in the process is important as we work with TGS on greenhouse emission reduction projects. 
Under Secretary Paula Dobriansky made a formal statement to the conference plenary last night.  Of significance, it said that the science on climate change was uncertain, which was criticized in the hallways by many delegations and observers. 
The U.S. delegation will meet with industry twice today.
The Pew Center on Global Climate Change has posted a good outline of some of the key issues to be resolved at COP-7, please take a look at it if you would like additional background or feel free to send me an email.

Re:? BF Capital Funding LP 
We confirm that BF Capital Funding LP is an active investment vehicle owned 
0.1% by the General Partner, IFS (Alberta) Ltd., which is in turn owned by 
IFS Inc., an Ontario corporation owned by a number of legal professionals.
BF Funding LP has previously undertaken, and will continue to make, a number 
of equity investments and in the proposed transaction will be purchasing 100% 
of the equity interest in Bow River Trust, a trust existing under the laws of 
Alberta.
For Canadian GAAP purposes, the General Partner of BF Capital Funding LP will 
be required to consolidate Bow River Trust back into its accounts for 
financial reporting purposes.
A 99.9% Limited Partner interest in BF Capital Funding is held by Royal Bank 
of Canada under Section 468 of the Bank Act.? As Limited Partner, Royal Bank 
of Canada has no control over BF Capital Funding LP and is not required to 
consolidate the partnership into its accounts for financial reporting 
purposes.

Jim,
I am sorry to bother you and I know that you had OK'ed this just 10 days ago, but in light of recent events I would like to check if it is still OK for my attending this meeting.  As Steve had noted before, this meeting is important from the standpoint of being sure the WECC is formed and our vote is important in  making this happen, however I want to be sure we still feel this is important to our core business before I go.
Thanks,

Jim,
	WSCC is voting on the formation of the WECC which will consolidated WSCC with the Western Regional Transmission Association and the Southwest Regional Transmission Association.  The Northwest Regional Transmission Association is likely to follow.  In order for this proposal to pass, 85% of the members must vote in favor and 90% of the control area MWs.  I think we should be there to vote for approval of the proposal.  In addition to combining the three (and possibly four) organizations, the change will alter the board make up, bringing independent members onto the board and allowing more latitude in membership.  The committees will be reevaluated as well and restructured over then next 2-3 years.
	Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board, so I talked to him about coverage.  He seemed to be uncertain about his availability.  I have an RTO West Congestion Management Meeting, where we are closing in on the final details of a financial rights model based on nodal pricing in real time.  I think I need to be there to keep the thing from getting fouled up.  Dave is close in Phoenix, so that was the reason that we tentatively made a reservation for him at the hotel.

Dave, Steve and I talked and due to our schedules and distance from Phoenix, we think it would be most effective if you could represent the company at this BOT meeting.  This is assuming your schedule allows and Jim is on board with one of us attending.  It will be an important meeting with approval of WECC and next year's budget on the agenda.  I am making hotel reservations for you, since today is the deadline.  I think you also need to fill out a form for WSCC; Jenny Remington is the meeting planner.  I will send Dennis Eyre a delegation after I hear from you and Jim.  Ray

Dear Robert: 
Craig Chaney asked me to review the proposed NDA that you forwarded to him in 
anticipation of a meeting between Credit 2B and EnronCredit.com early next 
week.  The NDA that you forwarded to Craig protects only Credit 2B as a 
disclosing party.  After discussing this matter with Craig, I understand that 
this relationship might rapidly evolve and require EnronCredit.com to 
disclose confidential information to Credit 2B as well.  Accordingly, I 
propose that in the interests of efficiency, we negotiate and finalize a 
bilateral NDA up front.  
I have thus prepared the attached bilateral NDA for your review and comment.  
I have taken Enron's standard form of NDA and incorporated those provisions 
of Credit2B's NDA to which I can agree.
I look forward to discussing any comments or concerns that you may have.  
Craig would like to finalize this NDA by Friday.
Regards,
Leslie M. Hansen,

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT
 Here's an update.  I have included Janice because of the overlap of some of 
the items:
1.  David Best is working on a very short draft reply to Mitsubishi's 
recently-received position in this matter, and will speak with Matt re the 
wording before requesting authority to send it out.  I will circulate it to 
you for your approval once I see the final draft.
2.  We still have not been advised by Mitsubishi who their lawyer or chemist 
will be in this matter.  We know that Mitsubishi recently tried to retain 
Tony Rooth of Watson, Farland, who was conflicted out because of the role of 
Watson, Farland's Singapore office in this matter.  We expect that the delay 
is attributable to the internal procedures at Mitsubishi that come into play 
when retaining outside representatives.
3.  Although the joint survey is tentatively scheduled for the week of August 
21-25, that may slide, given that ECT's chemist, Steve Jones, and the cargo 
underwriters' chemist, Cliff Bennett of Minton's, have not finalized the 
testing program that they will jointly submit to whoever Mitsubishi appoints 
as its surveyor. I agree with David that it is critical to (a) get the 
program right  and (b) make sure the lab (and lab technician) is capable of 
handling this testing.  The results of the joint survey will obviously have a 
significant impact on this case.
4.  Best anticipates that Steve Jones and Cliff Bennett will ultimately 
recommend that ASTM D 3605 with and without ashing be used (I have previously 
reported this).
5. In response to Matt's question about which testing method will prevail, I 
agree with David that from the standpoint of resolution of the cargo 
contamination case, we will not be in a position to determine this until 
after the testing is done and the results analyzed.
6. I have spoken with Best about Janice's comments to me about the risk of 
the substantial e-mail traffic in this case leading to inadvertent disclosure 
of otherwise privileged material.  We are both very open to communicating 
strictly by telefax or letter (or memo, with respect to my communications to 
each of you), if that does not impose an undue burden on anyone else.  Janice 
and Matt, would you let me know what thoughts/concerns  you have about this 
concept and/or how to implement it?
7. Janice has also mentioned that in resolving the cargo contamination 
matter, we need to be mindful of the confidentiality provisions of the FGH 
contract.  It strikes me that we will need to introduce some evidence of our 
contractual obligations to FGH and at least a specific description of the 
accompanying specifications in arbitration in order to recover.  Under London 
arbitration, documents that are received in the course of discovery are 
reportedly always treated as confidential and may not be disclosed without 
the consent of the party who produces the document.  Janice, I'll give you a 
call to discuss whether production by ECT to Mitsubishi of the terms of the 
FGH agreement under these circumstances runs afoul of the confidentiality 
provision.   
I welcome your comments and will continue to keep you advised.

Subject: CPUC News -- From Press Conference as we Speak
Body: 
Lynch and Wood Running the meeting
Lynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for high 
prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package.  
Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is 
34%.  Sellers ""have us over a barrell"" for those sales.  Attorney Gen 
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward costs 
-- this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care of 
in Sacramento.""  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow 
Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call. 
Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- ""our cries have fallen on 
deaf ears""
Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:
1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning 
4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 390 
(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas index 
from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, where 
prices have been more stable.
2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for 
purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for 
purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the 
payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for 
California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than the 
proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method, 
however.
3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X. 
(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge 
permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers 
ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers 
with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase, 
get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's 
accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Takes 
IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding 
during that time period (see # 5).
4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to see 
if it is best for the public utilities.
A new proceeding was also identified.
5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate 
structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use)  
Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided 
it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above -- 
would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.
In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to go 
after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.
I'm still listening.

Initially, trading on the online trading sites noted below will be conducted 
in the name of ECT Investments or ENA.  As Sheila notes in her email from 
earlier today:
If it is a fairly straight forward task to move the Credit and Convertible 
books into Enron North America, we should negotiate the new agreements in the 
name of Enron North America.
If is is going to take more time then we should go ahead in the name of ECT 
Investments and change it to ENA as soon as the books are moved.
Please advise.
 We may consider establishing an agreement for EnronCredit.com at a later 
date, but not initially.  
Thanks.

Subject: EnronCredit.com Limited brokerage agreements
All:  Just a status update on the growing number of brokerage agreement 
requests, and, I will circulate an updated list shortly.
On 8/8/00, Mike requested agreements for Market Axess, LIMITrader Securities, 
Inc. and Trading Edge on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited.  We have sent 
comments to the first two.  
Sheila requested a Morgan Stanley agreement for EnronCredit.com Limited (low 
priority).
ENA sent comments to Ing Barings (fka Furman Selz) some time ago and has not 
heard back.  We were going to dupe for ECT Investments, Inc.
Denis is the responsible lawyer for EnronCredit.com Limited..
If in fact these electronic agreements should be in the name of ECT 
Investments, Inc., then we'll negotiate from Houston (or divide and conquer!)
Sheila, your email of 8/18 seemed to refer to BuySideDirect's agreement with 
ECT Investments, Inc. (and not the agreements requested by Mike).  Also, you 
should note that BuySideDirect requires use of its designated broker, Weiss, 
Peck & Greer (I believe to take the other side of the trade or broker the 
deal with a third party)...We have received a copy of that agreement as well.
My goal here is to make certain that we are all on the same page and can 
continue to approach these agreements in an organized manner.  Please let me 
know your comments or questions.  
Thanks.  Sara"

Indiana Energy Investigation.  She has requested an interview with an Enron
employee who can describe Enron's experience in obtaining capacity on the
Texas Gas (Williams) and Panhandle (CMS) pipelines in Indiana.  The DOJ is
investigating whether Proliance is using its its significant capacity rights
on these pipelines to exclude or disadvantage third parties seeking access
in central Indiana.  Ptacek is requesting an interview this week or next

Jeff,
After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric =
Broadband (DCB).=20
1.=09The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Con=
roe Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholde=
r and is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, wh=
om you met recently at the YPO gathering.=20
2.=09DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cit=
ies in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a st=
rategy to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market the=
y are in requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in=
 a city is critical to success.
3.=09We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone Inv=
estors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to participat=
e with us in any future investments we make in DCB.
4.=09We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however=
 he made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not inte=
rested in the investment.
5.=09DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for con=
tinued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential inves=
tors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.
6.=09About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pac=
ific Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to=
 $75 million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial inve=
stment of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a sim=
ilar amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wirel=
ess access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice =
if EBS would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction wi=
th U P or on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a=
 strategic fit to their business model and would be interested in a much cl=
oser relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and =
 DCB are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has u=
sed DCB to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.=
)  Ken's response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB a=
nd he didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies. =20
7.=09We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about i=
nvestments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing =
funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's commi=
tment.
8. =09At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any addit=
ional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from ourselve=
s since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this investment. =
 They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic potential=
 of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving forwar=
d in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are curre=
ntly in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal struc=
ture by the end of May.
=09 We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way w=
hile making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a spac=
e that could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we c=
ould work together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit w=
ith DCB.  We will continue to develop relationships with other strategic an=
d financial partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investme=
nt in DCB.
=09I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We=
 will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we m=
ake in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Ben and Jinsung,
We have not had time to pass this information by the traders.  If we resolve 
the issues regarding location, unit contingency, etc., we can get a better 
number from the traders.  For now, these are indicative prices only.  Once we 
understand the deal better, we can talk to the traders and get a firmer 
price.  Also, Jim Fallon has requested that his traders receive a term sheet

Subject: RE: NEPCO Severance/Retention
Body: 
Good luck.
I would like the message to be even stronger than that -- he is not supposed to hire any outside counsel at all, for anything -- that is supposed to be done through legal department, per Jim Derrick's strictly-enforced rules.  He knows this and continues to violate that rule.  I suggest that he must hear a strong message, with disciplinary potential if he does it again.  Otherwise, this will have to be escalated to Derrick, since it continues to happen again despite my requests that he not do it.
In fact, he never contacts me for anything, which makes me nervous.  I would suggest that you would want him to have the same processes that we have in the rest of Enron regarding terminations of employment, which is that they go through legal if they are for any reason other than ROF.  That way, we may be able to catch some of the issues before they become more significant.  Similarly, I would like to be informed of employee relations issues that could bubble up into legal concerns.  I don't have much optimism for this, but still would like to ask for it!

Thanks for the response.  A face to face with Mike I sounds like a good idea.  Among other things, remind him to contact Michelle Cash when he intends to use an outside counsel for legal matters.  Also, I'd like to review his 2001 and 2002 HR Budget with you when you get your hands on it.

Saw the email you forwarded......someone's lost the plot here!
I had sent an email to Mike -hinting that there should no longer be a need for retention (didnt want to go into print and actually say NEPCO was off the table given there's still one interested buyer in play, and I havent yet thought thru the impact of bringing in a partner).
Have now left two voicemails for Mike asking him to call to discuss.
Will be talking to Brian about it today, and will probably go up to Bothell for a day next week (mountains and Mohammad)! Also plan on getting together with Aaron and Lydecker early next week.
Will keep you posted"

"Subject: ClickPaper transition
Body: FYI.
The ClickPaper group in Industrial Markets asked my permission to be able to say, ""ClickPaper will be upgraded to operate via the EnronOnline platform.""
I have asked them to delete the reference to EnronOnline and simply claim that this is a new version with many enhancements and new features.
While it may seem like their message gives a plug to EnronOnline, I think it will confuse the audience on what exactly is the relationship between ClickPaper and EnronOnline.
Also, we have little control over how Industrial Markets will promote ClickPaper and I don't want the market to think that any issues with ClickPaper somehow are a poor reflection on EnronOnline.

told us previously about this change.  ( Is this true???)  I told him it was 
news to me and that I would have thought that if true, then GE would have (a) 
highlighted the changes on the draft contract and/or (b) added it to the list 
of outstanding issues.
When asked to explain the rationale for changing their position on this 
issue, Steve was unable to give an answer other than to say GE mana. had said 
that they needed to cap their liability at the contract price for gov. 
violations although they thought GE could live with no cap on FCPA violations.

Did Steve S ask that it be added to the list?  I would let them bring it up 
if he didn't.  We spent quite a bit of time and effort on the LOL clause, and 
it was subject to lots of give and take.

GE has informed us during the Arcos discussion that GE senior management has 
directed that the GE deal team cannot agree to allowing GE indemnity 
obligations related with government fines for failure to comply with law to 
be exclude from the limit of liability.  
This needs to be added to Pete T's World Hunger Punchlist of issues.
Enron Arcos deal team has not agreed to GE's position."

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.
Thanks and regards.

The first problem is finding the time and money to do something and given everything else that is going on,  right now is not the best time to be spending some money.   To get the outside contractor taken care of we would have to let GSS find us a party to do the work, so you might want to be thinking of other parties who might be qualified to do the work.

Rod,
The Measurement Services Group would prefer to utilize UTSI as the external consultant for this review process due to their knowledge and experience in SCADA systems.  Internally, we need to include representatives from Gas Control, Gas Logistics, Measurement Desk, Gas Measurement Services and Field Measurement Services.
If you are in agreement, how should we proceed from here?

Rod, Charlie if we are looking for someone internally to do a review process, Sarabeth possibly can provide this function.  Your thoughts?

Do you have a candidate?    I would argue that we are looking at a process review, so anyone who can do a process review could do this.

Rod,
I agree with Kenneth Cessac's response.  We should evaluate our current process for collecting, validating and distributing measurement data and consider new ideas and alternatives to improve the process.  Assistance from a consulting firm that specializes in this area would probably be better than using Rutherford.

This question has been raised several times over the past 10+ years, should we combine GMS, Field Operations, and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data.  I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems.  
I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS.  While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling.  The IT department, Measurement Technology, Gas Control Hot Seat, and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS.  We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process.
 A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process.  Currently Field Operations, Data Analysis, and GMS all  manually review measurement data.  With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation.
I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items.  I feel that a company that specializes in SCADA and such as UTSI would be a better option.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete
The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology, gas control, gms, gas accounting, and gas logistics.  We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish.
The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this.
This effort would extend outside FA&A.
Please advise.

Mike, Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete.  Rutherford achieved what their goal was; to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner.  The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team.  The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed. There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized.   The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month.  What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them?   cvb"

1.  Resolutions of Salmon (page one is the two members electing the
designated directors, and page two is the new directors electing the new
officers).  I had previously furnished this to you, but the names of the
officers to be elected were blank).
2.  Resolutions of Salmon authorizing execution of the PPL promissory note
and related security agreement and the GE consent and agreement (these were
prepared by the Paul Hastings firm).
3.  Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency (this is required by
Freshfields).
The Secretary's Certificate with Incumbency may be required today.  The

Subject: 1/2 Day seminar: THE NEW TEXAS ELECTRIC MARKET
FYI,
I thought some of you might be interested in this half day seminar at UT.  
Bill Hogan, as well as speakers from the ISO and PUC are scheduled to speak.  
I plan to attend.  If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for 
$145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person.  Ross 
Baldick, one of Martin Lin's and my advisor is the moderator.  It may prove 
both interesting and contentious will Hogan being there.

U.S. TRADING SUMMARY
After Thursday's strong session that brought the tech-laden
NASDAQ back above the key 2000 level, a bit of profit-taking
kept the bulls in check early in the session. Various economic
data were released this morning and suggested that the economy
still remains sluggish  and is in the process of bottoming. This
helped bring out a further bit of profit-taking after the
various releases, but the selling was light. Indeed, the NASDAQ
vacillated around the unchanged level, while the Dow slipped
0.5% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%.
----------------------------------------------------------------
JAPAN / EUROPE SUMMARY
Europe's main markets rallied sharply by midday on Friday as
German auto maker VW and drug maker Schering posted profits that
were in line with expectations. Indeed, after a number of days
in the red, the major indices were poised for a bounce. The
French CAC-40 rose 1.7%, the London FTSE rallied 1.6% and the
German Dax moved higher by 1.4%. In Japan, earnings concerns,
especially among technology companies, took center stage and
dominated the mood in Tokyo, following poor results from major
players Sony and Fujitsu. The benchmark Nikkei dropped 0.5%
while the broad-based Topix fell about 0.7%.
----------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENCY SUMMARY
Initially, the dollar fell sharply versus both the European euro
and Japanese yen as slightly weaker-than-expected economic data
for the U.S. economy impacted negatively on the greenback. But
profit-taking and trader position-squaring ahead of the weekend
and elections in Japan on Sunday helped mitigate much of the
early dollar damage. By midmorning the dollar was trading at
0.874 dollars per euro while the greenback traded at roughly
123.9 yen.
----------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR COMPANY / INDUSTRY NEWS
(All prices as of 11:05 a.m. EDT)
** JDS Uniphase (JDSU: 8.48, - 0.99), the once highflying
technology networking powerhouse, reported a massive $50.6
billion loss for its full-fiscal year and stated that it would
slash another 7,000 employees from its work force. JDS reported
losing $477 million, or $0.36 per share, versus earning $137
million, or $0.14 per share, during the same quarter last year.
First Call expected the company to earn $0.03 per share.
Including all charges, the company lost $7.9 billion, or $5.99
per share, and recorded a full-year loss of $50.6 billion, or
$46.30 per share.
** Qualcomm (QCOM: 63.26, + 3.60) reported earnings after the
bell on Thursday that just beat Wall Street expectations. The
developer of wireless semiconductors and technology stated that
it earned $174.4 million, or $0.22 per share, versus $218
million, or $0.27 per share, in the same quarter of one year
ago. First Call had the average analyst estimate expecting
Qualcomm to earn $0.21 per share. Revenues fell 10% from the
same quarter last year.
** The U.S. Department of Justice filed papers late Thursday
that rejected Microsoft's (MSFT: 65.20, - 1.39) argument for an
appeals court to reconsider its unanimous ruling against the
software giant stating that Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive
practices. The Justice Department issued a seven-page legal
brief that summarily rejected the software giant's reasons for
letting the court revisit the judgment.

Most of you are aware that Unify experienced some major performance issues as 
we tried to close out the month of July.  Not to go into any details but 
there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the 
issues we saw on Monday and to a lesser degree on Tuesday.  Almost all of the 
issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of Sybase which is 
used for Unify's database.  Jeff Johnson and his team are putting together a 
plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in 
acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for 
August.  The short term tactical plans include the following:
Enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the 
amount of data grows.
Test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of Sybase which will address 
some of the issues.  This may also require some hardware changes as to where 
we store certain data.  We will also need some user help in stress testing 
prior to moving to production.
Addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled.  
I have been told that we still have transactions going back to Jan of 99 that 
have not been finaled or closed out.  This puts quite a load on the PMA and 
accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see 
what if any action should be taken with these transactions.
Once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little 
time to absorb the tremendous growth we've been seeing via EOL  then we will 
focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions.  These 
include the following:
Rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be 
much more scalable.
Moving off of Sybase and on to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.  It will be 
easier to move Microsoft SQL Server but we have to be sure it is the right 
solution in the long term.
Jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed 
plan.  Needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best 
people are working on these efforts.  This will slow down major enhancement 
efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and 
nominations.  We will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical 
solutions.  In the mean time feel free to contact me at x-36858 or Jeff at 
x-39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail.  Thanks!  -

Dear Mr. Morgan,
On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level

Hi Jeff.
I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.
I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Tom,
For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select ""commodity"" only as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as they are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should query by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (region codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not energy positions, per se:
10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)
Let me know if you have any questions!

3) The West looks close but the East is completely off.  Also, AlbertaENA should not be zero.
4) RetailEast & RetailWest are test Portfolios and should not be included!

Hi Stacey.
We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --
1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?
Thanks.

Paul - 
I have been doing some background research on whether we can use 
administrative proceedings at the FERC, State Commissions, the SEC (Public 
Utility Holding Company Act) and FTC to raise our issues with regard to 
E.On's anticompetitive activities in Germany.  As I mentioned earlier, 
Enron's ability to use US federal and state regulatory proceedings to 
leverage change in Germany is limited and could backfire on Enron.
For example, the standard used by the FERC to approve acquisitions of public 
utilities subject to its jurisdiction is limited in scope and does not allow 
us to intervene as an interested party simply because we have problems in 
Germany.  
I think the best course of action is to highlight this as a general Germany - 
US trade issue and get both the USG and the Congress interested.  There may 
also be some scope for raising this as a political issue in states where E.On 
is proposing an acquisition (let's hope they try to buy a Texas utility).
I have been trading calls with the German expert at USTR and I also have 
ameeting tomorrow with the Dept. of Commerce where I will have an opportunity 
to raise this issue. When you are here in august I can schedule other 
meetings.
I'll call again tomorrow so we can prepare some background information that 
will highlight our issues."

Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I

BRUSSELS, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Frantschach Pulp and Paper has ordered an automatic chip storage and reclaiming system for its two pulp lines at the Steti plant in the Czech Republic. The revamp will be implemented in two stages to avoid a shutdown. The first phase of the upgrade will be completed in February 2002 and the final work will be wrapped up in July 2002. 
 A spokesman said the Steti mill produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of bleached and unbleached kraft pulp. The new system will enhance safety and product quality. 
Steti's paper mill produces 200,000 tonnes/yr of sack paper, machine-glazed (MG) wrapping paper and linerboard. A revamp of the plant's PM is also planned for next year. The unit's 12,000 tonnes/yr capacity of MG paper is set to gradually rise to 31,000 tonnes/yr following the upgrade. "

Subject: New Options Model
Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

We've been keeping this deal in because I've been concerned about congestions at COB.  I'm not concerned going into February, so this contract is out of the money for February (probably in March thru May however).  If there is some reason to keep it whole, we have the length at COB.  Let me know what we want to do."

Hi Jane:
I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's ""windows,"" it will be interesting to see how this works out.

Body: 
 AND ENERGY CONTRACTS
Notice No. 00-313
September 7, 2000
TO:
ALL NYMEX/COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL MEMBER FIRMS
ALL CLEARING MEMBERS
FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF
RE:
POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 METAL AND ENERGY CONTRACTS 
[NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)]
As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals 
contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the 
first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.  
Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the 
October 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to September 18, 2000.
Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX 
energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the 
respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are below.
If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati 
at (212) 299-2920 or Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919.
NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE
(P) Concurrent Futures Positions
(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent 
position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset 
memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing 
such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay 
in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its 
clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing 
member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the 
clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.
(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for 
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third 
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, 
including the termination date.  The current delivery month in platinum and 
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first 
business day of the delivery month.
COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS
(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the concurrent position 
is established the business day prior to the date that the open positions are 
filed with the Clearing House.
(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for 
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth (10th) 
business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.
The current delivery month for Eurotop futures commences on the open of 
trading on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the termination of the 
respective futures contract, including the termination date.

George Bernard Shaw, they would have the ""E.B. G.B.s"".

Location, location, location...
Epidemiologists in recent years occasionally name diseases after the
location of the first reported case.
Lyme Disease (Lyme, Connecticut) is a spirochete (Borrelia) transmitted
by the deer tick; Coxsackie Disease (Cocksackie, NY), a rickettsial illness;
Pontiac Fever (Pontiac, Michigan) turned out to be Legionnaire's Disease
(after the American Legion convention held in Philadelphia, where everyone
became ill).

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--chautauqua
Chautauqua has been one of my favorite words since I was very little.
I was born in Chautauqua County, New York. My grandfather thought that
""Chautauqua"" had a rhythm to it (chAU -- tAU -- qUA ). He taught me to
spell it when I was two years old. The original Indian word means bag
tied in the middle. Lake Chautauqua rather looks like a bag tied in the
middle.

from http://www.jazzalbum.com/Resource/Word/ourlovehere.htm
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
Another trivia note about Gibraltar from the Internet Movie Database

""His real name was Roy Scherer, but talent scout Henry Wilson
invented a new name for his prot?g? by combining the Rock of
Gibraltar and the Hudson River.""

Subject: Norman Einstein
Quotation from AWAD, Feb 8, 2002:
> Nobody in the game of football should be called a genius. A genius is
> somebody like Norman Einstein. -Joe Theismann, Former quarterback
This quote which is rightly attributed to Joe Theismann has an even more
humorous explanation.
It turns out that Theismann went to high school with Norman Einstein and he
was the class valedictorian. This was verified by Sports Illustrated some
years back which ran Einstein's yearbook picture with the story.
So, when Theismann says, ""He's no Norman Einstein"", he means the same thing
as we do when we say, ""He's no Albert Einstein.""
How are we to know this?
Well, apparently Joe Theismann is no Norman Einstein.

Subject: ""till""
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/kilkenny_cats.html
I enjoy Word-A-day. Am I old-fashioned? Has ""till"" become acceptable as a
shortened ""until""? It rubs against my schooling in England. (See ""Killkenny
Cats"").
   ""Till"" is not a shortened form of ""until"". In fact, ""until"" is
   an expanded form of ""till"". ""Till"" is the older of the two and
   ""until"" was formed by adding the prefix un- to it. They are
   synonymous and mostly interchangeable. Here's a quick reference
   on acceptability of various forms:
   till  : OK
   until : OK
   'till : Not OK
   'til  : Maybe OK (only in informal writing)
   Well, schoolteachers are only human. To see more instances

Thanks for highlighting this word in your 'Facts and Arguments' feature

One of the more amusing mondegreens of which I'm aware relates to the
title of Malachy McCourt's autobiography. Malachy is the brother of
Frank McCourt and features prominently in McCourt's autobiography
'Angela's Ashes'.
Malachy entitled his book, 'A Monk Swimming'. In the book he explains
the origin of the phrase as being his mis-hearing the 'Hail Mary' when a
young lad; the relevant phrase being, ""blessed are you amongst women.""

A very volatile morning with the market and particularly the tech dominated Nasdaq generally on the defensive into midday.  The market got little mileage out of the surprising strength in the early Q4 Advance GDP report despite the fact that the number (+0.2%) was well above the consensus estimate of -1.1%.  Much of the unexpected strength was the result of heavy government spending and gains in durable orders (auto financing deals) and this may have kept investors from becoming overly enthusiastic about the data.  Also continuing to cast a pall over the market, at least in the morning, were accounting worries.  Speculation/reports that additional...

CONGRATULATIONS ON THE CLOSURE OF THE ALAMAC/AIG TRANSACTION!! Fantastic 
effort and job well done from beginning to end! I don't remember the other 
folks involved on your deal team but I do know this deal would not have 
happened had it not been for you three! I remember when we started this last 
July (remember the $1 DASH ?!), the hurdles that kept popping up (oh, just a 
little bankruptcy proceeding), and the s-l-i-c-k structuring of the entire 
transaction. Bought if for $3.5 million, sold it for $26 million, marked an 
incremental $5 million on a coal contract, and still have the right to 
""broker"" another sale and keep 90% of the proceeds ( another $10+ million)!! 
Pretty awesome.
This was really a great job by all! Let me know the date of the celebration

"Subject: Fort Pierce Pipeline Requirements

Body: Ruth,  Welcome to the Fort Pierce Repowering Project, aka ""FPRP"", (now that John has become a traitor err trader).
The following list contains the latest and greatest natural gas needs for this project (if anyone copied notices any discrepancies with my information, I need to know yesterday <- that soon):  Pressure Requirements:  per the Mitsubishi 501F technical specs, required pressure at the inlet is 530psi, however, this does not include losses.
Therefore, the required pressure off of FGT's mainline needs to be 560psi.
Hourly Gas Requirements:  even though we have reviewed various turbine configurations, the amount of hourly gas needed for this project has managed to hover around 2,100mmbtu/hr using 16 hour/day run cycles.
Looping vs Lateral:  we are willing to defer to FGT's recommendation provided that a single meter configuration be used as opposed to a dual configuration.
Timing:  plans are for the plant to be running in a simple-cycle configuration by June '02 and a combined-cycle configuration by Sep '02.
Therefore, we will need pipeline construction completed by Apr '02 for start-up and testing.
Phase VI Strategy:  the plan has been to either get this construction rolled into the Phase VI expansion (it would be the first piece of Phase VI initiated in order to meet our time deadline) or to have the construction covered by FGT's blanket for normal construction.
FGT Deadline:  It is my understanding that FGT needs to finalize the Phase VI plans by April 30, 2001.
That is everything that comes to mind at this time.
If you or anyone has any comments, changes, questions or interesting anecdotes, let me know.
Thanks,

Weather Headlines
Friday November 16, 2001
*** Another mild November weekend in store before changes occur to usher in
Thanksgiving.***
     Folks in West Texas or perhaps along the SE coast may disagree with
their rain and/or wind of recent days, but the pattern over the Lower 48
remains remarkably quiet and warm. It should remain that way until the end
of this five day outlook period. However, changes are brewing in Canada
that will send a cold front down the Plains and East for early next week.
True arctic air still appears limited in my view, but a sizeable
temperature drop East of the Rockies is still expected. It begins in the
Northern Plains late Sunday and gets to the East coast by Thanksgiving.
There is suddenly a lot of model spread in regard to the middle and end of
next week. I am not going to make any changes to my thinking until perhaps
next week because if I average the extremes I am seeing the result is close
to my earlier forecast. As for the extremes, the Canadian continues to be
in the winter camp. The second cold shot it develops by Thanksgiving in the
Plains looks way overdone to me. On the other hand the European and MRF
have a rapid warming underway in the Plains. I have said repeatedly that I
think the upcoming cold is a fairly quick shot in its extreme, but clearly
the main jet stream will be suppressed farther South making a rapid warming
suspect as well. So, until I see more evidence to the contrary, a general
forecast in the near to slightly below normal camp still looks good to me.
Some models suggest a winter storm of some significance is possible for the
East next week. I can sure see some potential of Lake effect and Interior
Mountain snows, but I am not ready to forecast this event for the I95
corridor.
For the period Friday November 16 through Tuesday November 20, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southern Plains ?
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Desert SW,
 California, Pacific NW?
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Mississippi Valley,
Southern Rockies, Intermountain West?
Average 7 to 10-degrees above normal: Northeast, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes,
Central Rockies and Plains?
Average 11 to 15-degrees above normal: Northern Rockies and Plains?

Subject: Sample JD Energy
Body: 
Michael,
Attached is a sample JD Energy monthly Emissions Allowance Price Forecast 
edited from our August publication.  A couple of quick comments.
1-You actually would be able to subscribe for $1,500/yr instead of the full 
$1,800 price because Enron already subscribes to some of our coal work.
2-The Monthly publication, as you will notice, often focuses heavily on 
interpreting short-term ""events"" and placing them into a context for the next 
few years.  The Quarterly publication which forecasts for the longer-term 
obviously spends more time on market and cost fundamentals.  
3-I will send you a Background Paper we did on NOx some time ago to give you 
a flavor of how we address the more technical issues in-depth.  We had 
originally only sent this one out hard copy because we often use a large 
number of diagrams and other tables that don't always reproduce well, but you 
will be able to get an idea of these papers from what I send you.  This year 
we are sending out all of our Background Papers in PDF.
4-Finally, as I mentioned on the phone, we encourage our clients to call us 
with questions and comments, ranging from looking for specific information to 
simply brainstorming different scenarios.  Finally, I make a point to get to 
see all of our clients in person each year and do not charge anything extra 
for an on-site presentation at a mutually agreeable time.
I look forward to hearing your reaction to our forecasting service.  Thanks 
again for your interest.

it's always been my impression that CRM assesses each C/P to determine

ECTRI is a UK registered company.  As a subsidiary of ENA, which is 
registered under US law, can my trader sleave deals through ECTRI to get 
around the eligibiilty issue.  We are working with Total to get a 
confidentiality agreement signed but it is taking awhile and we will not be 
receiving financial statements to evidence eligibility for another three 
weeks.

For SFA purposes as they are ulitmately owned by a quoted company on a 
recognised stock exchange then this is sufficient to sign them off.   I don't 
really know whether this makes them an elligible swap participant for the US 
though.

I am not quite sure I understand.  Does SFA requirements mean you have a 
guaranty, financial statements, or other material that establishes them as an 
eligible derivative customer.  One of our marketers continues to try and 
trade with them and I still don't fully understand how they are open in 
London.  Does meeting SFA requirements establish this customer as an eligible 
counterparty under US statutes?

I have a trader that is trying to trade financially with Total International 
Ltd., but we have asked that he not until we can sort our some eligibility 
issues.  Prior to speaking with Ben Hamida at Total last week, we had never 
approached them for financial statements or a guaranty that would establish 
them as elibible contract parties.  I noticed that we have significant 
financial trading with them in London.  How have you established eligibilty?  
My trader is asking, since he cannot trade under ENA with Total, if he can 
sleave deals through London.
Any ideas or insight would be helpful.

Vince,
Greetings.
1.  Per our communications earlier this year, you had agreed to participate
in a Feb. 22 panel discussion entitled ""Future of Energy Trading.""
We have now revised the format of the above Conference, so that our current
planning is this:  On 2/22, from 2 - 5 p.m., at the McCombs School of
Business, we will have a panel discussion that will focus on
""Enron/Andersen:  Causes, Consequences and Conclusions.""  We will invite
faculty, Energy Finance Group students, other students, other
practitioners, and possibly members of the press.
I write to inquire whether your earlier receptiveness to participating in a
panel discussion extends to this newly-defined topic.
2.  Alternatively, you had mentioned the possibility of coming to Austin in
early-to-mid Feb. to discuss matters with a smaller group.  I also seek to
discuss that matter with you.
I would like to call you this afternoon to discuss these two issues.  Best,
Ehud"

But I am still looking forward  to celebrating 5 victories in a row
1) Itaipu excess energy belonging to D/Rs
2) Changing MAE governance
3) Quotas with economic signals as opposed to rolling black-outs
4) No changes in Annex V
5) No caps on spot prices
Decisions on the last two ones should be made shortly. 
I may have left some enemies behind, but I leave with the sense of having 
fulfilled my mission.

Luiz. After consideration of currents events we believe this in an opportune 
moment for you to resign as President of Abraceel and turn over the reigns to 
your successor.  
Two reasons.  First,  the President's position in Abraceel is one that you 
could not fill from Houston and given your imminent departure you need time 
to advise your Board and plan for an orderly transition; secondly, as 
President of Abraceel, you are called by the press to make public statements 
to defend the position of power marketers in general. This is why we wanted 
you in that role in the first place, but due to the current circumstances 
that has become a temporary liability.
When you speak to the Press, you are mostly identified by the informed sector 
leaders as Enron, no matter how thoroughly you try to clarify that  you are 
speaking as President of Abraceel. In the meantime,  Orlando is in the middle 
of intensive negotiations with the government members and some of your recent 
comments have been untimely, in that it makes it appear, in public, that the 
Crisis Management Group issue leader, in insensitive to the power marketers 
(read Enron) position, thus undercutting his leverage. That also puts you in 
an awkward position, because as President of the organization you are not 
serving the membership by not engaging in the public debate.
But this does not mean that you are not still fully engaged in the battle!. 
Your prediction that the ""policy makers"" are taking decisions that will hurt 
the market may come true, and if so, we Enron, will come out fighting.  
In the mean time,  we will be needing your background and knowledge to move 
our viewpoints through the open doors that have been presented to us in the 
negotiations. 
Rick Shapiro has committed your assistance to the region as long as it is 
needed. Joe and Orlando would have wished that the clock could be stopped and 
you physical departure be postponed. But they are well aware that it is not 
fair to you and your family to postpone the move. We will work something out 
so that you can provide assistance from the USA.
Thank you for your perseverance on this long fight.
Jose

Jeff,
My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and we can go from there.
Much Thanks!
Sam.

Taffy/Tana, Thanks for sending us the requested doc.s
Paul, I have started to prepare the mirror English Law doc.s.  Just a few 
questions:
Schedule:
1. Elligible Currency - I presume that in addition to USD we will have 
sterling?  And Euros?
2. Is an Enron Corp. guaranty to be provided?
CSA:
3. Notification time/Resolution time in the US doc.s are 10 am and 1 pm New 
York time respectively.  I suggest that mid afternoon London time should be 
adopted for the convenience of both parties.
Many thanks
Michael"

Hello.
I have one original Enron signature which I can have delivered today.  If
we need more, then I'll have to get more signed (duh).
Thanks,

Below is a link to the prepared testimony of Michael Travieso, Maryland People's Counsel, at the Barton RTO hearing last week.  His comments on the importance of a fewer number of RTOs, each with a broad geographic scope, track our own views.  As with the CFA report by Mark Cooper several months ago, these consumer groups are important to showing third party support for our efforts, particularly among Democrats in Congress.

Kay,
A few weeks ago I spoke with John Keffer regarding Sweetgum Energy LLC's
request that Ben Jacoby sign unanimous resolutions of CAED I & II approving
the sale by CAED I and II of their respective GE turbines to Sweetgum.  As
of today, Sweetgum has not received back the resolutions signed by Ben. As I
explained to John, Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate Ben's prompt
execution and return of the resolutions.  If Enron does not wish for Ben to
sign the resolutions, then Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate your
advising us of that as soon as possible.
As I explained to John, Sweetgum would like to have unanimous resolutions as
this is more customary and cleaner, however, since Ben received the required
3 business days prior notice of the proposed resolutions, the resolutions
only need the majority approval of the board members.
I would appreciate hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.
George"
